These three things come together to construct the child, leading to a perfectly adapted to time, place and culture. 

At this stage, the children have input for language acquisition and development, movement, culture, religion, attitude, sight and smells, texture and taste. 

The child is a very powerful observer considering he is immobile for a long time. It is primarily focused towards taking and observing the environment in its truest sense. 

Life begins in the womb of the mother. Upon birth they become embryo but a spiritual embryo. Spiritual embryo can also be understood as psychic potentiality of the child. This potential requires stimulation from the world to develop. This development is not genetic based. The child is born with nothing but nebulae or a potential. Nebulae is derived from astronomy, a dust cloud that creates stars. 

The child also possesses an energy that drives them to develop and meet predictable milestones that are global to all children. This energy is referred to as horme.

The child is not only building a synaptic connections and absorbing information, but they are also going through the process called incarnation. 

Incarnation is the information comes into the child and it is literally creating who this child is going to be. The child is acquiring their first language also known as mother tongue. It plays a role in the formation of their own personality. 

As the subconscious mind absorbs the environment around them and start to incarnate the information such as language, movement, order, culture and adapting perfectly in time and space.
