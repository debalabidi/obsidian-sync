Montessori talks about observation in very specific terms. She, in fact, pretty much says if you don't observe you are really not fulfilling your role as a person who is delivering scientific pedagogy. So observation is part of the scientific method, and she makes it part of the teaching. So what is observation? In the simplest way you can think about it, it's looking. Now, it's not just looking, because I can look at anything. But it's looking with knowledge, and awareness.




I think it's the most important tool for the Montessori teacher is to be able to know how to observe. Without observation there is no way you can understand what’s happened in your class. We're really training them to be scientific observers, but basically because you are conditioned 
not to make judgments, you start changing. You start changing through observation and you start
accepting what you see in front of you instead of trying to change it. And that's a transformation for the individual, because we are always trying to change someone. I think you cannot change it. You are going to respect what you have in front. You have to accept what the child is doing.

Observation is important because I will approach each child each day as a new person, as a new child. So I don't bring what happened yesterday to the new situation. And because I know how to observe, and I am also free of what happened yesterday, when I see this child I offer a new person as well. So the child, even, or an adult, can have the opportunity to be different as well. If I come with the idea about what's happened yesterday to our new experience, I'm transmitting to the child my feeling of yesterday.

And the child will react exactly the way Iexpect him to react.So, I am the one that can transform if I am free. If I see a person, or a child, with whom I have a problem, or with whom I had a situation, and I approach him the next day with the same eyes, or the same feeling, I'm transmitting that feeling and it goes on and on forever. If I can just be present and be able to observe, and that means observation, you're going to see those children as new children every day.


You have to have a silent mind. Silent mind means that, "I am going to observe in such a way, and I'm not going to bring any past experiences to our new experience. I'm going to free myself for all preconceived ideas about what is a classroom or what is a child." You are fresh. You are fresh, and your eyes are fresh, and you accept situations, human beings, children, conditions, in a totally different way.

I start working with my students, I say that, the moment that you say "the child is not working," I ask them,"Why? Does he has to be working? Is that an expectation?" So they realize that yes, they're having an expectation. Why he has to be working all the time? Children need to rest. Children need to observe. Children are absorbing all the time. So you do not need to be pushing the child to work all the time. He's working. He's constructing himself all the time. So when you think that the child is wandering, he's absorbing, and he's observing. 

I think many aspects of observation are similar, primary and elementary, in that we're looking for how to best meet the needs of the children. At the elementary, I think it becomes crucial in needing to be able to observe and know when to intervene and when not to intervene. We want to step in before they get frustrated. But we want to hold back and not step in if they're working it out in a productive way. So I think that's where a lot of the art of observation comes in, in elementary.

Observation is also our guide as to when children need the next presentation. And so, observing and asking ourselves, is that still productive? Or, do those children just feel really safe with what they're doing? They're busy. They're doing problems, or they're doing a grammar box together, but are they getting anything out of it, or are they ready for that next presentation that will take them a little bit further, that will stretch them. Because that's the job of the teacher, to stretch the children.

It's a trickier thing to do, to observe an elementary class, rather than a primary class. The reason is, primary children work individually, and you're looking for concentration. And when they're really engaged in a project or an activity, you can see that concentration, you can just see it happening.
And you see them manipulate the material.

In an elementary classroom, you're looking for different things. And it's harder to see. The things that you're looking for are those psychological characteristics that have come into being between the ages of six and 12. So you're looking for imagination and the reasoning capacities. So those are hard to see. You can only see it from the children's work, or the ideas that have gone into the work.
You're looking to see how they work in a group, because that's another characteristic. That's easy to see in the elementary, because they just collect together. It's like magnets, they're drawn to each other.

Now, because we offer freedoms in the elementary, and one of the freedoms is communication, you have to listen to their conversations. And you can't judge those conversations, because there has to be a balance. There's certainly going to be a lot of social discussion, but it's natural for these children because their task is to learn how to function in society.

In the primary they were learning to be an individual, in the elementary their work is to become an individual within society.

So you know that for a child in the second plane it is almost a given that they'll want to congregate with other children. You know that from the theory, from many other people's observations.

So when you observe that there's a child who's complete loner, who never interacts with anybody, who does not speak with anybody, who does not interact, then you say to yourself, "Huh, what's going on here? This is not the way that a child in the second plane normally behaves." Then, what do you do as a result of that? So your tool is observation, and the tool is used to repair, or to somehow fix it. Fix it the best way you can.

And you would then observe for a few days, because maybe it was just that one day you happened to notice. But over time you saw, huh, they never really do that. And then you can take steps to either, from your own knowledge, just go and try to form a relationship with the child so that this child can open up to somebody. And often they will open up to an adult, whereas not to another child.

You might have to seek other guidance from administration first, and then from other experts in the field. But there's more to observation. Observation is looking at everybody and being aware.

I would cite one example of observation. You're in a group lesson, and a child timidly asks a question, kind of slips it in there. Just (mumbles), and they don't really articulate it very well.

And the teacher just goes on? No. That's not a good plan. Stop. "Excuse me, I heard you say something, I didn't quite hear what you said. Would you say that again?" To observe that a child wants to participate and is unable at that moment to be as assertive as they might need to be. But not let those opportunities go by.

So we have language, we have mathematics, we have geometry. And one of the things that Montessori teachers, elementary teachers, and primary teachers, are cognizant of is that they want to see a variety of work going on in the classroom. It's not all mathematics, or all language. No, this is one of the things that we, as teachers, need to observe about our own classrooms. Margaret Stevenson said, "Be careful that you do not expect only math, language, and geometry in the morning, before you can allow your children to do geography, biology, or history."

All of those especially important subjects for cosmic education. Those subjects where the children see an inter-relatedness. She said, "Make sure, that throughout the day, the children are able to work on all of the subjects throughout the morning." And that is your job as a teacher, to look around and see what lessons that you've been giving, and what kind of follow-up is happening. And the way that you manage that, as a teacher, and this is especially important for new teachers, is you need to have a record-keeping system that helps you give your lessons.

You need to plan for every child throughout the week. You may not get to these plans, sometimes you hope you won't get to them because that means the children have come up with a plan of their own.

And because we leave them free to work on their spontaneous ideas, that means that the plan you had may have to wait another week, which is perfectly fine. And it's through your record-keeping that you go, "Oh, I need to give some more biology. I need to give some more science. I need to give some more of that." But it's through the observation that we're trained to do. And so you just have to keep that at the forefront of your mind. 

Another observation is to have a conference. We have conferences with children in the second plane. Another observation during that conference is how forthcoming is the child about what they're doing? Are they trying to kind of smooth something over? Are they not kind of telling you what's going on? Just observe their affect. How is it that they are thinking to talk to you?


And that way you can help them by being responsive to them. By saying “oh yeah…” Or bring up something that they are unable to bring up. "Well, yeah I saw you doing that the other day. What was that all about?" That kind of observation.


So, I think in second plane of development, the observation is that of engaging with the child. And really looking at what they're doing in terms of how they should, I don't know, should be developing, but how they would characteristically develop, and see if it's off point there.

When I think about the strong qualities of a Montessori teacher, I think that one of the most important is to have self-knowledge. To know more about yourself. And a Montessori teacher requires to have a special transformation. It's really a kind of transformation in the way she sees children.

We talk about spiritual transformation because you have to be able to go inside yourself and know yourself very well. That's why I feel self-knowledge is something that it's extremely important.

Not just for a Montessori teacher, but I would say in any profession. Because you have to be very honest, and very authentic in what you want, and what you do. So in my work I usually ask the teachers, when they say, "I love children, that's why I want to be with Montessori, to study Montessori,"

I always say, "I'm concerned about your love for children. I want to know the real motivation about why you really want to work with children."

And many times, they don't know. They don't know, and I see that as soon as they start in being in contact with the theory, with the philosophy, you can see the transformation.

We want to really understand, what's going with the human being. So when you start talking with a student, and you start explaining about what is a human being, they start in some way recognizing themselves.

They start recognizing themselves in what you're teaching to them.

So it is really a conversation between human essence to human essence.

So when you are giving the course, you are touching the core of something that resonates to them.

The moment that you start this conversation on a deeper level, and you connect that also with their own lives.

With their own lives, with their own upbringing, with psychology, and how this psychology's also part of our course, then they start understanding, and they start looking at the child in a different way.

So the transformation comes through the dynamic of the training course.

The training course changes. We're not just teaching materials, we're giving a way of life.

The philosophy and the authority is so well-grounded because it's based on observation, and scientific observation and experimentation, is not imagination, not a theory.

It is something that you can see. Montessori was very concerned about the human condition, the human being, evolution, ecology, nature.

She was concerned about what was happening. In many ways, she was concerned about how human beings, as a species, as a human species, can survive. And you only can survive if you are healthy. And she was looking for healthy human beings. Healthy in their mind and healthy in their body. And it's a balance.

So from the beginning of life she start talking about mind and body together.

What is also very interesting, is at the end of her life, she was saying, "no one has understood me."

At the end of her life she says, "I have been pointing out the child, and people are looking at the materials.

It's not the materials. It's what's happening with the child."

Montessori just say, "Look at the child, observe the needs of the child, and give what the child needs."
