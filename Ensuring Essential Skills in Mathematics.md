Quickly identify deficits and carry out plan that appeals to second plane characteristics.

Move children as rapidly as possible and there will be fluctuation of groups at some times because some children will move more quickly than others. 

Work diligently everyday  8 to 10 weeks and if you dont see progress you want to seek additional support.

be consistent in your presentations, in the repetitions and children don't progress, you need to ask why.

Figure out exactly where each child is and start working from that Point. Just do what is necessary to bring the child upto speed

Use more language in your presentations.
You are going to make links to reason and imagination.
You will move at a faster pace.
Lessons need to be short , consistent spread throughout the day.
Lessons maybe little longer than language work. Maybe 15 minutes instead of 5 minutes
Work will occur in groups generally. 
Prioritize building up of self confidence - meaning end presentation while the children are feeling successful rather than going on too long. 
Will use select pieces of material from CASA using that appeals to 2nd plane. (Borrow them and removed once we no longer need them)
You as a teacher must approach this work with the children and no one else. 
Children need attention from you as the teacher.
Golden bead and decimal bead material in divisibility and squaring.
Lot of variety in math. Basic math work must not be the child's only experience with math.
Basic skills must be worked on in conjunction with and reinforced with the other math as soon as possible. 
Most math chapters begin with sensorial activities can we suitable for weak children.
Approach math with children as an exciting adventure to undertake together.
Very limited amount of knowledge included in basic math. (tell the children this to elevate any stress or overwhelming feelings)
They need to know how to 
- count numbers one to ten
- The function of zero
- Understand the categories of the decimal system 
- Be able to read numbers
- Write numbers (good to have, initially reading number is more important)
- Need to know about 4 operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)
- Understand the meaning of these 4 processes and how to use them to find certain answers.
- Once they have understood these processes they need those math facts available in their minds. (Memorize more or less so they can do some of that abstract math work)


**Observation and Skill Assessment**

You will find the most Accurate information about what the child knows when you actually work with them. 

Continue asking the question, what does the child need to know to be successful with this new information? Or what does the child need to know to be successful with the next presentation?

When we assess th child, it is not enough to know that he cannot do the problem. We need to know which skill is lacking and understanding or which skill is lacking in practice.

One key to helping the children along is to focus on these little parts that are missing alongside the whole. 

Need to assess what the children understand generally in terms of math, can they count? Recognize numerals, write symbols, understand the connection between the quantity and the symbol?

If skills are lacking you will present each one systematically in some ordered ways, using techniques that will support repetition with variety that are suitable for our 2nd plane child. 

Begin right away to assess their knowledge. When you work together. Children may have forgotten over a long summer vacation or other things may have happened for them to increase their knowledge. 

Be sure that they can
-  Count from 1 to 10
- Read numbers
- Associate quantity with symbols.

How many fingers do you have? Practice with it, for variety you can count the bead bars

Do a three period lessons with the bead bars

You want to know if they can write and read those numbers. 

Sit right next to the child and have the child watch you as you write a number with your whole arm in the air. Then ask the child do you know what number I wrote? Let me do it again. Sitting beside you will give them the same orientation. Then invite the child can you write a 3 in the air and evaluate if they can do it. If not then borrow sand paper numerals from CASA in a game like way introduce some numerals with three period lesson, 

We approach the formation of written numbers in the same way that we would approach the formation of hand writing.

Check association between symbol and quantity. 

Once worked on it , then borrow number rods and cards from CASA.  Scatter them and do three period lesson.


**Value of Concrete Experiences**

Assess that they understand the concept of four operations. If not then you will present with the golden bead and decimal bead materials. Stamp game is not suitable for 2nd plane child. The bead is the most concrete representation of the decimal system. 


If child is struggling that tells you the child needs a concrete experience for true understanding.  Stamp game is symbolic. It uses green for example, to stand for both the units and the thousands. The golden beads for a thousand actually has thousand beads that is a more accurate representation. 

The golden bead material is more suitable for group work more synced to the 2nd plane characteristics in ways that stamp game cannot. 

With each of our four operations, there are four steps and the particular steps are designed to supper the process toward abstraction:
- Introduction of the concept. (parallelly start working on memorization / reference the memorization finger charts that come from the CASA at any time. / have them at distance on a shelf to support memorization ) with golden beads. Present in small groups and control of error will be in the group. We want children moving around in the classroom with their trays and collecting beads , cards, counting out loud, performing any other movement etc. 
- 

Children can also use hierarchically colored decimal cards with the materials for variety. Or for variety they could write the quantities on labels. Those same small cards are used for commutative and distributive law.
Note: some children will move quickly and some will need more repetition. 

1. Introduce teh process with the materials (we name the operation and we write the problem on paper, we show the sign paper, but focus on process)
2. We work out the problem with the material and stop category  by category with the material. After we find the answer in the category we look at the written problem and say does that make sense to our brains?
3. We still use the materials but we look at the problem on the paper first, category by category and use the materials to check the work. 
4. Using the paper and pencil without materials to do teh problem abstractly. 

If the child has not learned the math fact yet, they will get stuck on the 3rd step and we can tell them to go and get the answer in their head from the operation control chart. 


The conversation when you ask the children if the digit makes sense is significant. (Critical thinking is practiced and additional repetition via variety is realized. )

When children can verbalize the process and the reasons when they do teh work eventually without the materials they have strategies for deepening their understanding, not just simply a set of rules to follow. 

For addition and subtraction complete all four steps and for multiplication and division as soon as the concept is understood (other materials can be used)

**Independent Exploration:**

As quickly as possible give them presentation on how to make their own problems.  (keep in mind the power of independence in this area)

If children have some strategies for creating their own problems. That will bring excitement to the work. More so that's whatever uninteresting problems in teh thousands we can come up with. 

Challenge the children to write problems. 

Problems with the digits of their birthdays.

Use teh heights of the children in the class.

Use address numbers or zip codes 

Work journals and use the time they recorded. 

Keep some dice in a basket on the shelf for some random problem creation

Perhaps the 20 sided poly hydren that has the equilateral faces.  Acosta hedren that Platonic solids. 

Casually wonder around , how would seven board racks and tubes problem work?

Sometimes bigger problem dont feel like review to the children, they feel like a new exciting work. 

What about the big game with three zero or four zero?

What about a pair of die?

Percent problems and 10 sided dice that decadron. 

**Practice with the materials**

Children who need practice with place value, counting, exchanging quantities, the beads and cards are also a way to support this learning. (golden beads and hierarchically colored cards)

start with first category and then work upto 4th category. 

First will fetch the corresponding beads to match their quantity or the reverse. They begin with the beads and collect the cards. 

With the golden beads we do it differently compared to 1st plane. 

Work with the cards in a stacked pile of the category in teh same way that we keep our cards stacked for the rest of the elementary work.

use humor and make mistakes in elementary. This can catch attentions

We work in pairs, work in groups often experienced child can support repetition with teh inexperienced child. 

We build repetition by having each child listen while the results are counted and verified. It also allows them to be correct in the answer.

Facilitate the work with older children builds in that repetition for 2nd plane. 

For variety of the categories and counting, number base boards with the golden beads instead of placing materials on a table etc. 

*Interest is rooted in personality*

**Cultivating number sense**

Treat

What if we considered math combinations of sentences with numbers representing nouns and operation signs as verbs?

We have an infinite number of nouns and only five verbs. (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and equal)

We want our children writing and speaking complete sentences and math. 

Math is our daily language. We use fractions to cook recipes a knowledge of percent to shop patterns and relationships to convey information.  

Is a language of communication - it contains rules , structures and logic.

Is broad and creative, its interpretive  topic of study requiring analysis and interconnections. 

At core. It is about reasoning and patterns.

People with number sense can use math in a flexible way.  6*6 =36 and so 6* * 7 = 36+6 or 7 * 7 = 49 and 49 - 7 = 42.

This number sense allows us to consider a reason that a method makes sense. 

Allows us to think of alternative methods.  This provides flexibility in thinking beyond calculation alone. 

Best way to develop fluency with numbers is to work with numbers in different ways,  not to memorize or even worse, not to memorize without understanding. 


Children understand more complex functions when they have a deep understanding of numerical principles.  (It is not the fast recall, not a blind memorization)


Significant difference between low and high achievers. High achievers use number sense. Low achiever dont.  Low achievers are because they dont use numbers as flexibly as others. 

Number sense is inhibited in children when we overemphasize memorization of facts. 

Don't develop number sense when they put energy into rote memorization without true understanding. 

Strategies and memorization in combination will help. 

higher achievement level for strategies
