- Study of life, exploration of plants and animals
- Allow the child to have own first hand experience with them.
- Present lessons by highlighting plants are part and parcel of life.
- the interplay between plants and animals, and animals and plants and earth.
- Bring plants and animals into a prepared environment. (To care for and learn about them, by providing first hand experience)


#### Before child enters in CASA
- Has had some experience with the plants and animals, gathered impressions which are unnamed and unorganized.So we give names and classification by giving nomenclature.Builds vocabulary(as a tool) to order mind and intellect.
- Each new word allows the child to store an impression. Process of ordering the mind, the child builds intellect.
- through enrichement of vocabulary and reading classified material - able to categorize information.
- Practical life - explores plants, leaf patterns or different calls by birds, requires careful observation, water plants, clean, notice they need water, and sun shine. 
- By caring we are teaching what is necessary for their survival. They are experiencing it.
- Child sensoria's explorer, by offering botany cabinet, shapes of leaves, the cabinet is limited (The botany cabinet intentionally does not have all types of leaves. ), so the child can make his own discoveries. 
- THe materials are means to understanding the world. This is not a study of botany. A preparation for later study of botany and biology
- When child is nature he will be attracted to flowers, (avid explorer) types of petals, shapes, and scent.
- When the child is introduced to the botany cabinet they are introduced to the shape of the leaf and not the name of the plant itself. Plant name by themselves do not allow for ordering and classification. It is through learning of characteristics through which a child will learn to classify information 
- There are many aspects that attract the children to animal:
	- Sounds, 
	- Ways the move
	- Variety of color and shape.
- When casa environment is prepared properly
	- Children will have further opportunities to explore them. 
- children will notice the animals
	- Home, eating, external factors, might learn interesting specific facts.
- when the adult **indirectly guides the child's observation** to the needs of the animals. (preparation for work in elementary)
- When the guide helps the child to observe, teh child becomes interested in the  animals and their needs and develop an interest in it. 

#### General points for second plane
- Different child moving from being a sensoria's explorer / absorbent mind to exhibiting active imagination and developing the ability to reason. 
- We present to those aspect of his mind that appeal to him, that is how we capture the child's interest. '
- The child is no longer interested in just the facts. This child wants to know the reasons for things.
- Not interested in fish is dead but why is it dead?
- Allegory to capture interest, and impressionistic charts.
- Goal is to introduce child, biology and zoology
- Air , rocks , water and sun - lack of harmony - something else came to restore order and harmony - that is life. 
- Process of earth to go through to be ready for earth. 
- We present to children the cleverness of nature , how different life forms need same thing  in different ways diversity in them. points of interest.
- Children need time to classify and order information, their human tendency to order and to orient to the universe.
- Developing analytical ability and scientific classification. 
- Through the classification child is making a choice using visual analysis and reasoning, into an orderly structure. 
- Developing human potential, reasoning and developing and making decision based on his analysis.
- The structure of biology in the elementary classroom:
	- Observation and needs of plants and animals
	- Careful observation leads to understanding physiology
	- This helps them develop their observation skills and is a life long tool that they can use later on in life. 
	- Observation of nature serves to norish the child's aesthetic imagination. (flowers, leaves, seeds shells, etc)
	- Through observation they become engaged, must go out into nature and discover.
	- To see how clever plants and animals are. 
	- Have books that deal with plants and animals outside the immediate environment that the children are living in. 
	- Keep in mind the limitation of not bringing in too many books into the classroom. Books no matter how lovely are no replacement for the children engaging in the environment around them. 
	- No description in books / muesuem are capable of fully representing nature. It's effects on soul. Something that speaks to the soul. A soul is deprived if not in nature. Something that immanates from the trees and nature effecting the soul of man. 
	- Realize delicate balance on earth. Biology builds responsibility. How important it is to make a responsible choice when given 

#### Botany in the elementary 

- Pick plants  with children because they are aware of animals 
- Children usually are not as well aware of plants and the diversity in them. 
- Plants offer experience in a way that animals dont. 
- Begin by presenting Needs of plants for survival.
-  
- Early activity that allows children to work together. 
- psychological characteristic of the elementary child to work with others. 
	- Working together and collaborating is a skill and some times they need to develop those skills and these early lessons lay the foundation. How to function as part of the group. 
	- We introduce the physiology of each part of the plants first.
	- The physiology explains the reason: leaves make food for the plant, in order to do that they need light thus they grow towards light.
	- This allows the child to link between the observation and the knowledge and how the plant adapts in order to serves its purpose for survival.
	- We bring the attention of the child to the six parts of the plant:
		- 3 vegetative (helps them grow) parts: leaves, stem and roots, 
		- Reproductive parts: flowers , fruits and seeds.
		- Introduce each parts its function and variety. 
		- Main function will explain the behavior (of the part)
		- It's not a linear path , different exploration and direction and variety and cross pollination of ideas that come from the children and not the adult.
		- Parts of functions of the parts are introduced through stories, and when possible the story begins with a question (engagement of reasoning mind). Did you ever wonder how plants eat? Today we are going to talk about it. Alleviate the language captures interest.

#### Zoology :
- Must have interacted with animals, (zoo, nature , pets etc)
- Fasinating they are, noises, different types, etc.
- This natural interest is used by guide to develop human potential.
- Basic skills, they will do their own reading and writing, research because of interest. Expansion of vocabulary and self expression if we as guide encourage and foster it. 
- The power of observation. via books about animals, keen development of observation.
- In cosmic education we are not teaching zoology, botany , geometry or arithemetic. Instead of teaching individual subjects we are helping the child develop his potential through the study of topics. Providing opportunities for self construction. 
- Child is learning to observe and express himself, to write, read, draw, vocabulary, developing powers of observation
- Child is interested in how and why - because of reasoning mind. We help them become aware of aspects of animal as it relates to their environment(earth).
- Lives and fate of animals and also plants are effected by the environment. 
- We direct the child to observe the needs of the animals and their behavior. For survival. 
	- Realization - all animals have the same needs but satisfy it differently. (How and why are correlated to each other for the child. )
	- Tell animal stories different variety of behaviors.
	- One need is food - deer eat grass, teeth are designed for chewing, lion for tearing... diet for different teeth. Predator vs grazing animal. 
	- Eat different times will eat different times, different ways swallow vs nibbling. 
	- Consider movement limbs for flying vs jumping or slithering observe how it is moving that is the power of observation. 
	- Mammials hair grow back to the front . Moles have it two different direction. 
	- Sloths hanging upside down all the time. (hair from belly to the back, why? So when it rains , water runs off the body, inside the sloth fur is a whole ecosystem, that is a story for another day. )
	- Care for and observe animals. As a teacher it is your responsibility that the needs of the animals are met
	- Develop responsibility by care of animals. Water, fed , ( child) tracks it. 
	- Not every child is attentive. One way to ensure is having a record book for each animal. Before the task, and record it, it preserves the independence of the children. 
	- One of each verbetrate and inverbetrates.
	- Amphibians or reptiles to start with it. (Sturdy reptiles)
	- details provide opportunities to considerate.
	- Clean cages, handle animals, when not do approaches, like reptiles(when molting) very vulnerable at that time.
	- Need to have a plan on how to care for plants and animals on extended time the school is off. 
	- Grant based program for children. 
	- Lending museum.
	- Borrow an animal from child.
	- Insect (if you bring them in , provide a the necessary habitat and return them back to where you found them once done.)
	- Allergies of children to mammals or birds. 

#### Classification of Plants and animals
- First hand of experience - leads to classification , 
- Introduce basic classification first - merely a grouping , the child has to make observation and a reasoned decision on its categorization. 
- We give scientific classification because it serves as the key to his learning. 
- Classification is natural to the mind. Order his knowledge and reasoning abilities. 
- Helps develop the child's reasoning mind and clarity of thought. This is very satisfying for the child because we have a tendency to order and classifying allows for the intellectual ordering of information. 
- Ecology - study of relationship of organism to one another. 
	- Everything is interconnected and related
	- Environment is important impact on the life of animal
	- Healthy relationship between animal and environment balance is important.
	- Human have great power to influence the environment , if children understand this, they can help in the balancing act. 
	- Relationship between living and non living and the interconnectedness. Botany and zoology that there is a connection between plants and plants, plants and animals and animals and animals.
	- We dont look at them in isolation but in a holistic way , 
	- History question charts?, Highlight environmental factors.


Cosmic task
- Relationship between life and the environment. 
- Survival of species
- Remote and unknown to species is to create balance in the environment. 
- Every creature has a reason for living and is connected to cosmos.
- Life of corral - drink water to live, second task , removing calcium carbonate from sea. Or the earth worm , insects, pollination and food by flower, from flower to flower, micro organism that eat decaying matter. 
- Saw humanity continuing the process of evolution. 
- As humans are conscious collaborator.
- Idea of playing a part in teh cosmic plan to become responsible via stewardship of the world. 
- Each individual can make a difference. 


Biology 
- Integrate into and contribute to society at large, practical applications that can be built upon what the child has learned in teh second plane. 
- Dr Montessori envisioned a prepared environment which is land based learn about argiculture , gardening and husbandry. 
- Economic independence is what the adolescent seeks, ()
- Drastic and radical physical transformation (violent)
- Learning of changing puberty (allowing to learn human biology)
