### Introduction

The subject of geography is unveiled through the story of God with No Hands. It sets up everything that we present in cosmic education. For all other presentations the guide must question themselves how can each presentation be related back to the story of God with No Hands. It is our job to understand the connections of everything in the Universe so that we can help the child make his own connections. 

Dr Montessori said :


Geography , Physics and Chemistry are all part of the same whole. They all relate to the earth and is part of the universe.  This allows us to introduce to children all aspects of earth science to the children and let them explore the phenomena around them. 

To enable children to visualize what we are talking about, we must understand imagination and how it works and then offer lessons that spark that imagination. Presentation must be geared to go beyond just the explanation for they must stir the child's mind and imagination. 

We must offer ideas to imagination which will help the child see relationships. 

These aids to imaginations aren't designed  to create reality or recreate reality. They aren't designed to give exact scientific information. They are used to give an impression that raises they awareness of basic principles. 

We hope the child will think and wonder of the ideas that we present and the mystery of the world. 

These ideas help the child understand the physical world.

Our job as a guide is to enthuse the child to the inner most core. 

It is in how to tell your story that you appeal to the second plane child. If you get him interested you get him working. The role of the adult is to be the link between the child and the environment.

In the first plane it means we link the child to the material. 

In the second plane it means the child is linked to the understanding of why  the world work the way it does.

We as guides must be the link between the child and the principles that govern the universe.

### Geography in the CASA De Bambini:

The child is introduced to both physical and political geography.
We begin with sand paper globe just to distinguish between land and water. 
The child is then offer further discrimination to continent with painted globe and the first puzzle map. 
Then we lead the child to countries, the child's own country both using the puzzle maps and the flags. 

The absorbent mind is one that will take in all the facts and impressions offered without discrimination. This is the ideal time to present the nomenclature of political geography. We help the child to further extend and categorize this information through associated reading classification and vocabulary enrichment. We present land and water forms to the young child giving the impression of land forms and the corresponding and contrasting water forms.  It is initially sensorial in nature but is also eventually used for building reading and vocabulary enrichment exercises too. What is the difference between a lake and cape.  What is the difference between Island and peninsula.

Geography folder = pictures from each continent introducing the idea of social geography and the concept of fundamental needs. All human beings meet their needs for food and water clothing shelter transportation and spiritual fulfillment. But they all do not do it in the same way. It is often the environment of the people that influences how these needs are met. The geography folder illustrates the similarities between everyone in our global family and its foundational to the human studies on earth. 

### Geography in the elementary:

6 chapters in geography
1. The creation of the earth and the idea of the universe
2. The nature of the elements
3. The sun and the earth
4. The work of air
5. The work of water
6. Human geography

Many of these idea run in parallel to one another. All referring to the idea of principles that we shared in God with No hands.

You will create variety in your classroom by going in different directions of study with different groups of children.This not only helps to foster community with one another but also create a rich and vibrant environment of learning. As we present these concepts we engage the child  imagination by using impressionistic charts and demonstration of concepts

It's only by engaging the imagination we bring the magnitude of universe and the wonder that is all encompassed in it. 

#### The creation of the earth and the idea of the universe

Study of geography and the drama of cosmic education with our first great story God with no hands. 

The great story is an introduction to what exists around the child. They inspire and aid the understanding. The first 3 great stories to develop gratitude  toward God and creation and the underlying law and order of the universe.

Everything that happened before the coming of the human being had to happen in order for humans to survive when they came to earth. We aim to bring this understanding  to the child fostering an appreciation for all that surrounds him.  

Purpose to introduce the child to the whole reality of the universe. By giving the framework we allow the child a place to fix and place his ideas/ to organize ideas.

The story is given in the first week of school. It sets the stage for cosmic education. It is only by figuring out the larger picture of the cosmos does the child understands or can explore his or her place in the cosmos or cosmic task.

The role of the adult is to get this going by providing an imaginative incentive for the child.something around which the imagination can work.we present a framework through impressionistic charts and simple demonstration we introduce the idea of that earth is made up of different layers. These layers have different thicknesses and compositions.  We explore the idea of the earths crust made up of two different kinds of rocks.  That it moves, these plates move. The results we see as human beings because the earth is made up of the crust and has different rocks and they move around and how we as humans experience it is all brought to the children. 

#### The Nature of the Elements

One option after the story of God with No hands is to explore the nature of the elements.

The second plane child is attracted to order and the law of things. We capitalize on this interest and present the idea of three states of matter and their laws to the child.

In the first great story we introduced the idea that solids, liquids and gases have properties and laws they must follow.  

While solids have particles that cling very closely together but liquid still stick together but are more accommodating than solids while gases have particles that do not cling together at all. 

Solids push downwards, liquid push downwards and side ways and gases in all directions. These principles are the reason why things are how they are on earth.

We also present the ideas of combining and separating. Combining substances can have different results and those results actually are largely classified by how you can separate, if you can separate  the original substances. These experiments aid the child's understanding and give a foundation for scientific exploration. They also develop awe and wonder. They ignite the child's imagination and spark his interest. As we come to understand the basic scientific phenomena of earth like the force of gravity and the effect that gravity can have on liquids and solids deepens the understanding of the child. 

#### The Sun and the Earth

Introduce the two movements of the earth. Revolving and rotating. 
Bring awareness to the idea that earth is a sphere and what does being a sphere mean.
Introduce the concept of day and night on earth aka rotation and the concept of timezone. Day for some humans while night for others. It fascinates the children.

Season exist due to revolving of the earth. The solstices, the equinoxes. There are areas in the world where the sun never sets or never rises at certain points in the year. With this we entice the child's imagination and explain via the fundamental tilt of the axis of the earth and the movement of the earth. It is because the earth is a sphere that it is tilted (tilt of the axis of the earth) and revolves and rotates we are able to live on earth. This awareness brings to the child the conciousness the interconnectedness of everything on earth to the earth and the idea of cosmos. 


#### The work of air

Dr Montessori called air the **cosmic agent** on our planet. It works in several ways impacting our lives. The story of coming of life, air has a big job to do. It must move constantly covering the earth keeping her warm while at the same time following its laws. This personification of air introduces a character into the drama the coming of life and plants seeds that we build upon in our geography lesson. We introduce the child to the work air does and reference the laws it must follow. Air occupies space, hot air rises and cooler air rushes in to take its place.It is important that the child know the particular laws of air on earth so he can understand the results. We discuss the importance of the layers of atmosphere. The role it serves to keep earth inhabitable for humans. The winds behave according to the temperature of land or water the surround manifesting in land and sea breezes. We bring awareness to how winds work and consort with the currents, how they change with the seasons and the way the sculpt and change our world. In connection to history we go into deeper study of the winds how they have influenced the exploration of human beings and how they were named. 

There are also aspects of work that effect rain, orographic rain, equatorial rain. Introduce the idea of local conditions for rain and the effects that can be seen. 

#### The work of water

Is another cosmic agent on the earth. It's essential for survival of plants, animals and human beings. Water works in several ways:

Human and water
Different aspects of the work that water does on earth. 
Introduce the child to the work of th river. The river has the job of carving, carrying and depositing. They flow from high lands to low lands, following the laws of liquids.
Rains work too, in conjunction with winds they sculpt the land.
Water also alter our land through the ocean waves.
We bring the the child's attention glaciers. The work of the water still carving, caring and depositing as they move on land. 
Summary of the water leads to the idea of water cycle. The idea of finite amount of water on earth that moves in an endless pattern following its laws. 

Dr Montessori said, 


#### Human Geography

It has to do with us as human beings vs traditional geography.
What we want to impress upon /make them aware  children is how the geography of a certain area effects people. Lives of people , products that can be grown/ produced. 
Introduce the concept of interdependency of human beings. This idea is supplemented in history with the idea of migration of people and our exploration of culture through the history question charts. With the child we look at different people of the world. We explore what their housing is like, what their crops and food are,  what kind of clothing they wear. and then through the exercises of economic geography we present ideas related to the natural resources, the industries that have developed in certain places. 

This work of interdependency can be explored at the state or country level depending on the interest of the child and by the end we will be looking and the world wide connections. The purpose is that children realize the interdependency of the entire world community. 

We help the children understand how and why we are so interlinked and interdependent and how something in one part of the world can have an effect on the rest of us. 

Give them the truth of the situation as it exists.

### Geography and the Adolescent

The educational plan for adolescent as presented by Dr Montessori, is divided into three general parts:
1. Exploring ways of expression.
2. Fundamental needs that contribute to the building of man.
3. Theory studies that are general education of the day
Within the third group falls the study of earth and living creatures. What she called the study of human progress and the building of the civilization including but not limited to geology, geography,physiology, astronomy, physics and chemistry. 

The foundation of knowledge that is created in the second plane of development is built upon in the third plane and given more practical relevancy to the work of the adolescent. This instruction is given to the adolescent in a way that appeals to his characteristics and allows for hands on application and exploration.


Dr Montessori said, 
Instruction should be scientifically correct related to simple everyday facts. verifiable via observation and experiments. The theory should alternate with the practical work,in order to give it wider application and make it more interesting. 


### Conclusion:

By engaging the reasoning mind and igniting the active imagination we present geography and all it encompasses to the second plane child. We do it in a way that enthuses and inspires. It is our task to connect the child to the wonder of all that is around us and provide him with the tools he needs to explore that which he finds interesting.

If we bring to the child the vision of the world impacts human beings,we bring the possibility of understanding the world and his place in that world. We offer the child the opportunity of what he can contribute to the world and what his cosmic task might be.
