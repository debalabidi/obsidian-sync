You search for anything using a search engine so building a simple search engine can be one of the best projects. Applying a ranking algorithm can give better results.

**Abstract:** Simple Search Engine is a Java application developed using Servlets, SQL Server, and Oracle database.  It can include features like a search bar, which displays the top 30 websites related to the keyword searched. The database containing resource description is described in SOIF (Summary Object Interchange Format) format. The interaction with the search server to access the database is dependent on the Java interface provided by classes in Java SDK. Your search engine contains a history of the pages you searched for, pages visited in the past few days, accounts linked with it, etc. 

**Technologies Required:** Java, Java Servlet, Oracle or SQL Database, JDBC, Apache Tomcat, and JSP.
