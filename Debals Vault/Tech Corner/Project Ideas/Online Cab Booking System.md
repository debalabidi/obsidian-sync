Ola and Uber are the online cab booking system that almost every one of us has become used. So building such a Java application would be the best idea. 

**Abstract:** In this project, the main objective is to help customers in booking a cab to reach their destination with pick-up as their preferred location. The application fetches your pick-up location and asks you to enter the drop location, when entered, finds a cab driver nearby and even tells you the calculated time the cab will take to drop you at the location. The system is designed using Spring MVC, Servlets, Hibernate, JDBC, JSP, HTML, and CSS. 

**Technologies Required:** Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP, JDBC, Java Spring, Java Servlet, MySQL, and Tomcat Server.
