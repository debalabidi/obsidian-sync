- [[Children with different needs]]


Children that have aversion to reading:
- dont react . and acknowledge the aversion. acknowledge it that it doesnt make them feel good and it is not about reading. 
- Develop relationship in other areas. 
- After success .... maybe u read with the child based on their interest. Reading is filled with amazing and interesting thing rather than boring things. 
- Take it slowly. 
- have a conversation with them 
- work with writing with live writing with their stories. 
- other children when they say that you are on that level. that is so easy.... that is dismissive... verbal thing.... 
- verbal put downs. address them immediately.
