Make two presentation summary cards for each of the presentations (note that Function of the Layers will be added to the Introduction to the Layers):  
  
1-**Introduction to Layers of the Earth**  
(since the **Function of the Layers** presentation is so short and simple, add it, and its title, to this card)  
  
2-**Relative Thickness of the Layers**
