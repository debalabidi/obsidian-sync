Because each of these is done at two levels (impressionistic and then later, with language), you can make a card for each experience **_but_** be sure that you indicate the two experiences clearly (such as, "1st impressionistic, 2nd with terms.... and ...." or something like that). If there are slight differences between the two, indicate that as well.  
  
Make a brief sketch for each. Include key language.  
  
4 cards:

3-**Impression of Mixtures** (1st impressionistic, 2nd with language)
