There are **three parts**:  
1-Listen to the audio lecture and also read the text (you can do this separately or follow along--your choice).  
  
2-Create a mind map or outline to support your engagement with the text. This should be done on the same size paper that you will use in your albums so that it can go into your albums. _Doing a mind map or outline supports you in helping you extract the main concepts and ideas of the text._  
  
3-Write a short reflection (about 1 page). This is your personal reflection on the lecture topic, designed to deepen engagement. It may include anecdotes, opinions, and ideas for further reflection. Please reflect on the way the work in geography fits in the idea of Cosmic Education.
