Read these selections from Montessori's books:  
  
**From Childhood to Adolescence**  
Chapter 6--Water  
  
**Creative Development in the Child, volume two**  
Chapter 19--Water*  
*_note: this is the chapter for the two-volume set--the chapter number for the one-volume edition may have a different number_  
  
**Chose one passage from each book from the chapters on water that resonate with you, are significant for you, or inspire you toward further contemplation**.  
  
Write a paragraph about each passage (include the passage in your submission) explaining or elaborating about why this is. Be prepared to discuss this during a class/ group discussion at our upcoming synchronous module.  
  
**Purpose**: We are trying to dive more deeply into this work--there are so many presentations in so many areas that it is easy to get into the habit of becoming a "presentation machine" and it is easy to lose the narrative of Cosmic Education. Water is such a significant part of Cosmic Education--Montessori clearly felt so as she brings up water again and again in her writing and in her lectures.
