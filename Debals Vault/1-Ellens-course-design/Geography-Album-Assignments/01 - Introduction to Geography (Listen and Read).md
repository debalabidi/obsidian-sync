Listen and read over the Introduction to Geography. If this were a fully in-person class, you would listen to the lecture and take notes. You don't have to listen and read at the same time--you can listen and read separately, but I think having both experiences will allow you to pick up details that may be missed if you did just one or the other.  
  
Once you have listened and read, please indicate that you have done so in the comment box.
