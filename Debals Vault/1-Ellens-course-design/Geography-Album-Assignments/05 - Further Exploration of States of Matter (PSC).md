I realized I hadn't actually posted the due date on this assignment. **It was due way back on June 10th.**  
  
Many submitted (it was on the list of things due, but the actually assignment didn't ever get updated with the due date).  
  
If you didn't previously do this assignment, please do so. **I'll make the due date for those who didn't do it when it was first presented to be October 7th.**  
  
Make presentation cards for the presentations. These can be very simple! They need mostly a brief sketch and the main names of the ideas. Include any key language.  
  
4 cards (or two 2-sided cards):  
  
1-**Explorations of Solids: Rigid, Elastic, Plastic**  
  
  
2-**Explorations of Solids: Degrees of Rigidity** (What Effects Plasticity?)--(**sketch the 5 different explorations**)  
  
3-**Explorations of Liquids: Fluid and Viscous**  
  
4-**Explorations of Liquids: Does Temperature Affect Fluidity?**
