Four cards:  
  
1-**Temperature Zones**  
2-**Temperature Zone work Chart**  
3-**Protractor Work Chart** (you can use my illustrations for ONLY THIS ONE or you can make a very rough sketch--don't get too caught up in the illustration) you must annotate with what you would say--brief! Be sure to show all four special days (two solstices, two equinoxes)  
4-**Work Chart for the Seasons** (illustrate all four seasons)
