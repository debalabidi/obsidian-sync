Make a one-page flow chart or summary of **all** of the economic geography presentations. Be brief, but be sure to make a simple summary of what **each activity's purpose** is.  
  
The purpose is to give you a one-page easy-to-understand overview of **all of the activities** that are included in economic geography.  
  
Be sure to be neat--this will go in your album.
