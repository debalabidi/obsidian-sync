Make this material for your classroom.  
  
NOTE: The first North America map posted was missing the mountains--thank you, Althea, for letting me know the mountains were missing! I've since uploaded a new version which includes the mountains.  
  
For North America and Taiwan, I will provide master copies of templates that you can use (see below). If you want to do a different country, I'll provide some tips below.  
  
What you need:  
--A blank outline map of the continent (or in the case of Taiwan, we used the whole island). It should have no color nor any political boundaries. It is best printed on stiff paper or card stock.  
--Three sheets of clear plastic--you can usually get this at a good art supply store or store that sells drafting supplies. You may also be able to use something similar, such as a heavy-duty sheet protector cut apart.  
--A clipboard or other way to secure all four layers so the won't shift as the children use the materials (see below).  
  
It is more dramatic and interesting to the children if this is a bit larger than standard paper size. A3 or "US Folio" (11"x17") is a good size. If you can't do that size, then A4 or US letter-sized (8.5" x 11") is acceptable.  
  
Method of creation:  
1-Trace the main rivers of the continent on one of the clear sheets. I prefer to use a blue permanent marker (Sharpie or something similar).  
2-Indicate the main mountain chains of the continent/island symbolically (we use a chain of upside down "v"s) on another clear sheet. I usually do this with brown permanent marker.  
3-Indicate the high population areas with small red dots (again, permanent marker) on the third clear sheet.  
4-Assemble  
  
**When assembling**:  
Bottom layer is the outline map.  
Next layer is the mountains.  
Next layer is the rivers.  
Top layer is the population centers.  
  
Attach the sheets together in some way that they won't shift relative to each other (which could skew the impression). You can punch small holes at the top and use paper fasteners (use at least two) or some other way. Sometimes I stitch them together.  
  
If you have a clipboard or other stiff backing, that is great, but the most important thing is having the map and all sheets.  
  
Photograph your creation so we can clearly see that you have done it as indicated above. Upload your photos here.
