You will work on this first in small groups in class and then refine it on your own to submit here.  
  
You will be making a visual summary of the first great story. This is a one-page summary of the main points and ideas and should include both little drawings to "cue" you as to the charts and/or demos at each point in the story. Also, the key idea presented at each point.  
  
This one must be hand-drawn and written on paper. You can, of course, use a computer to do your brainstorming if that works best for you, but this final one needs to be hand-drawn and written on paper.  
  
Your drawing skills will not be judged here! We are looking for your clarity of thought and understanding of the story and so very simple sketches are fine (please use some color for important details where color matters).
