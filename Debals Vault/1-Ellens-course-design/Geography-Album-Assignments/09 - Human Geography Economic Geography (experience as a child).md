You will be making samples of work as the children would make them in class. This is an important experience to have--to do things as the children would do them.  
  
If you have access to the materials, you can do this now. Take a photograph of your work and upload it here. You will also include photos of these samples, or include the samples themselves, in your final album.  
  
If you don't have access to the materials, you can do this work when you get to Spokane. **I recommend that you don't do this option unless you really don't have access to any economic geography stamps.** Our classroom has just one set of stamps. **You can't do this work during supervised practice--you will need to stay after class and/or come before class or on weekends to get this done.**  
  
**Please follow the directions carefully and also look at the samples in the handouts.** You are both having an experience like the children and making samples for the children. We can't accept them if they don't meet the criteria we are expressing here. If you want to do something different, ask first or you may put a lot of time into something, but then not have it accepted.  
  
If you are planning to do this in Spokane, please make a comment in the comment box stating this intention. We will put a "1" to remind us that you still need to do this when we get to Spokane.  
  
If you don't put a note in the comment box you will get a "0" and it will be considered missing work in terms of being able to hand in an album, being able to practice teach, or being able to take exams. **It only takes a moment to leave a note, so please be sure to do so if you will be doing it in the summer. We wil then make a "due date exception" with the summer due date.**
