Be sure to watch the human interdependencies video.  
  
Make a one-page flow chart of the various activities. Make little sketches to show the layouts of the various cards (they can just be rectangles with codes--no need to draw little pictures unless you find that fun).  
  
The purpose of this activity is to create a one-page easy-to-understand summary of the various activities for this work.  
  
Be sure to include the names of each of the activities. You may want to include, for each, the purpose or the main important key for each one.  
  
It will be included in your album, so be sure to be neat.
