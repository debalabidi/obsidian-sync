Make the complete set of cards for your classroom. Also make (or find) envelopes and be sure they are labeled.  
  
In addition, develop one set of cards for "where do we get our...?" for a new product (not reflected on the current cards). It can be a product that the children in your area use or eat. **It is fine for many or all of you to collaborate to develop this set, but each student must have printed their own set.** Some examples that you may find useful are (below are examples from my Taiwan course):　  
  
Where do we get our food from? White rice (I suggest white rice since it has the step of polishing)  
Where do we get our food from? tofu  
Where do we get our food from? soymilk  
  
You may think of others.  
  
The required sets are:  
A1--Where do we get our food from? Bread  
A2--Where do we get our food from? Meat  
A3--Where do we get our clothing from? Cotton  
A4--Where do we get our food from? [student choice]  
B1--What does the farmer produce?  
C1--Whom does the farmer need?  
C2--Whom does the toolmaker need?  
  
Photograph your sets and upload them here.
