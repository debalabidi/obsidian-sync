Transmission of Knowledge at best Muharram even Harvard cant make so much content.

but Harvard can create paradigm shift in cultures by just publishing a few papers. 

Doesn't look like we are going anywhere intellectually....?


Ethical impact is not significant. 


So much content but not significant impact. 

West tongues are so sharp. The way we talk and judge people. 

education is a combination of taleem and tarbiyah. (taleem is knowledge or information) and tarbiyah is acting upon it. 

Purpose of Education ? Why am I delivering this lecture? 

Major theories that discuss the purpose of education. Certain purpose of education in the outside world. 

Objective will change what you say how you say , and what you focus on. 

We may have a correct or true objective. but society has other objective and you pick their things and you are stuck with it. 

hijab is my obligation vs hijab is my choice... the freedom of choice... the language is changing.

Social justice.... shape your language, imam Hussain stood for social justice, but not stand up for shariah law... the language is changed.... 

language has changed...

What is my end goal? what are the possible objectives of education?

Plato, Socrates, both from east and west.

Four or five prominent objectives: there are more than that. 

Order of prominence and Islamic objective will come in the end:

- Purpose of education is societal and communal ( from western philosophy )
	- get job, invest back in society, the crux of the purpose of education.
	- your job is to make them strong in math, science, etc. - so they can reinvest in the future.
	- if you don't have skills they are useless to society and we have failed in our objectives.
	- you will have justice if everyone is educated. 
	- This impacted Muslim scholar - Ibn Hamdun.  (Plato)
		- impacted by Greek philosopher.
		- every society has need, for example, food/farming, sewing/clothes, construction/shelter, politics/harmony.
			- so then you need skills. then they will have jobs etc.
	- These skills will enable them to function. 
	- They were not ignoring the soul aspect. 
	- You have to care about spiritual refinement. 
	- Some philosophers took this and removed the spiritual refinement. 
	- Ethics have been ripped out of the education system. 
	- Completely stripped from morality. 
	- creates a dichotomy (split in people , just education only skills no spiritual, and the other say only akhlaq and no skills) 

- Second objective, 19th and 20th century
	- for the sake of knowledge itself. 
	- Who ever has more knowledge, has value. 
	- This will allow them to integrate seamlessly
	- and those who don't have knowledge are lower order society. 
	- democratization of knowledge (Wikipedia)
		- 1897 - 
		- ilm becomes a veil - if you want ilm for the sake of ilm.
