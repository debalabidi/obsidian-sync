verb...adverb...pronoun

can look at these three types of words as a family...work together to make a verb phrase

verb gives energy to the sentence...like the sun in this chart

adverb is like the moon...takes its energy from the verb just as the moon shines using light from  
the sun

pronoun flies like a rocket (or a comet—Maria Montessori used both comparisons) towards the  
verb to help it

I run quickly...they eat carefully...we devotedly work...you thoughtfully help
