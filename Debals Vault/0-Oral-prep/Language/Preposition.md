Which word told us the relationship between the box and the beads? without  
We call those words prepositions.

transposition:

For each transposition ask : **Does it make sense?**

What if I move all these words...  
(without the colored beads)  
...to the beginning.  
Without the colored beads take the box.

We’re moving this whole set of words—it is called a phrase. A phrase that starts with a  
preposition is called a prepositional phrase.
