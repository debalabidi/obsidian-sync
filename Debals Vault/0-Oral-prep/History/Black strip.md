- Remind of first great story.
- it was dark and the earth was forming. 
- The dance of the elements was taking place. 
- the earth started to cool down 
- and then it started to rain
- it rained and rained
- look back 
- it is still raining
- then life came 
- single cell
- multi cell
- formation of shells and coming of life on land
- amphibians to reptiles to early mammmals
- in the end came the humans
