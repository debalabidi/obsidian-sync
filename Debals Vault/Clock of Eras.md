# Story

## Setup
- Gather a group of children.

So we have been talking about the creation of earth and we have been asking how long did this all take? We are going to be looking at that again today. We are going to look at it here with the clock of eras. If you look here, we have a clock broken into 12 hours just like we have over there on our clock in the classroom. It's the same. Look here's our 12 right at the top, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and back to twelve. Just like our clock. 

Well when we had our black strip you remember that we talked about how the earth had been here for a long long long time, but human beings hadn't been here for very long at all. We are going to look at that again, but today we are going to look at it here on this clock.  

This clock is all of the time that the earth has been here. Let's start here at the 12.  This is where teh beginning of the earth is on our clock. Do you remember how we thought how hot we talked about the earth being right at the beginning and so much cool had to happen. It took a very long time for the cooling to happen. For some settling down, so that our rocks could form, so our valleys and our mountains that was the formation of our crust. It took all the way to 4 o'clock. From 12 to 4 on our clock. 

And when once it was cool enough for our crust to form, it was cool enough for water to stay on teh surface of the earth, and it rained. And it rained , and rained and it rained and it rained you remember that? It just kept raining and raining and all that liquid was filling the crevices and filling the cracks and filling our oceans.

But also as it was raining, it was picking up minerals from the rocks and washing it into the ocean. that's what happened, and our oceans got really filled full with salts and minerals and there was an imbalance. 

Somewhere in this time came that little drop of life. To bring harmony back to our earth. And all those experiments in the ocean started happening. We had unicellular life and then multicellular life. Remember we talked about the cells kind of specializing. Not every cell had to do everything but there could be specialized cells, all those experiments happening in the ocean, all the way up to ten o'clock. 

This time period when all those experiments were happening in the ocean, this time period was called the archaic era. Archaic means very very very long.  So we have gone from 12 all the way to ten o'clock. 10 of our hours have passed. Now we are here, and scientist have a lot more information about these two hours. This is where we start on our timeline of life, and that book of life that scientists are able to read, they are still reading it today and making new discoveries and so we can make discoveries based on what science is finding out today. 

So here we are, and we are in the Paleozoic  Era, during this time that's when our trilobites lived and our sponges, jellyfishes all sorts of sea life and here towards the end of sea life, and here towards the end of teh Paleozoic Era, that's when we had fish and amphibians. So Paleozoic , zodiac means living being, and paleo means old. Old living beings, the old animal life and then we come on and we are in the Mesozoic Era, and the Mesozoic Era that is when we had our reptiles and our birds and Mesozoic means middle living beings, so that zoics the same, living beings but meso means middle. It's called teh Mesozoic Era because it is between the old living beings and the recent living beings. Mesozoic in the middle. 

It is towards the end of this time, that we had mammals, yeah, we are all the way at 11:43 and 11 seconds for mammals to arrive and then we come to here and we are in the Cenozoic era, and this period of time here, many of the animals we know right now have only been present since this time. This is the Cenozoic Era, zoic again being, the living being, Ceno meaning recent. Recent animal life. So many of the animals we know have only been around for this amount of time. 

Now we are here at 11 hours 59 minutes and 45 and a half seconds. And you can see this thin red strip, you have to look very closely, because it is very small. This red strip here, this is the Neozoic Era. Zoic again being living being, and Neo meaning new. A new kind of life. 

Out of 12 whole hours, its only for the last 14 and a half seconds that human beings have been here. We certainly have not been here long have we.

# Notes
- Give impression of how long the humans have been on earth in relation to time being expressed as 12 hours on a clock. (human existence less than 30 seconds)
- Similar to black strip - which emphasizes the amount of time vs clock of eras being more scientific. 
- In this we name the eras, and talk about the eras - we did not introduce the eras when we did the timeline of life. 
- A compare and contrast can be done between the timeline of life vs clock of eras.
- Important: Colors on the clock of eras need to match the band at the top of the timeline of life chart. That lets a child relate to the timeline of life creating a visual correlation with clock of eras. 
- The words gives children a place to look when further explorations to learn more in-depth.
- This demonstration will not be effective if the children do not have a sense of analog time. Find out if they know how to determine analog time. If not work with them to learn how to see analog time / how to read a clock then work with them from day one. 

# Andreas Notes
- This presentation is a way to display data in a different way. It has a companion chart of legends/Keys that matches the color and lists out the different Eras. 
- This allows the children to see the data in three different ways. One expressed in analog clock, one in begin and end time and one in terms of hours. 
- These can be referenced and used when we are doing some measurement and data work and then when the children are like , I don't even remember what this is about, you give them a little impromptu lesson to spark their interest in this again at a later age. 
- Some children are going to love the way this is presented. 
- When first presenting this, recommendation is to leave it out for a couple of days, and let children look at it, think about it, make little comments, see what you hear, have a few books that they can look into and find things about the Paleozoic Era, find things about the Cenozoic Era etc.
- Give them some information that they could follow up on their ideas and interests and dig a little bit deeper. 

# Questions
- When you say leave it out for a couple of days, I am assuming that it goes on a shelf near the timeline of life? Or do you leave it on a table where it would be more central and  visible while the children walk by?
- Do you introduce the books after the presentation or while you keep the materials for display for few days.
- Does this necessarily have to be just a few students or it all students show interest they can get lesson?
- Do you use short stories to create interest in a specific Era for further exploration?


# Todo
- Create a page for early intervention or first week work assessment.
