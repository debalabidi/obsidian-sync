- Needs for survival. 
- Despite differences in environment, all life were based on law order and pattern.
- Intelligence alone doesn't help to reason but relies on law order and pattern.
- Mind can imagine, in history man has used the environment to invent, create and making life easier and better.
- Mathematics had to do with the lives of human beings since they first appeared on earth.
- Everything created , discovered, has its roots in mathematics.
- Tendency to create and invent is based on law order and exactness.
- This tendency is inherent in all human being including the child. 
- We approach mathematics from 3 different perspective:
	- Arithmetic , algebra, geometry
	- As adults we combine arithmetic and algebra
	- But in classroom we are presenting cosmic education. We present all three in relation to one another. 
	- Uniting the three has been found to be a great help and very effective. It is as if instead of balancing the subject on a precarious pole, we have a tripod for stability.
	- By not limiting scope we allow for integration of mathematics into cosmic education.
	- Observe patterns and cycles. Patterns are primarily numerical.
	- Child begins to understand the practical patterns of regularity in life.
	- Organization of our lives follow the human tendencies to order. , explore, to be exact , 
	- Out of observations comes generalization and from that comes systems of thought. 
	- Math is not approached as a subject.but rather as an invention of human beings mathematical mind.
	- Humans have a mathematical mind. 
	- Pascal referenced in her quote.
	- Precision and exactitude.

- ### Mathematic in CASA

- Interest in numbers
- Birth to three, language of math part of environment.
- We must count things for the child.
- Practical life and sensorial area, pre math ideas.
- Practical life develops concentration , concepts of logical thinking. Sequencing of activity, develops into logical and orderly thoughts. 
- Child discovers all activity has a beginning , middle and an end.
- These experiences increase sense of order, recognize organization , attention to detail.
- Language and the underlying concepts of math are the essence of the presentation in practical life. 
- Judge too much soap, vase is too short, not enough polish. When we pour water, we have divided the water, and sometimes we have a remainder. 
- Sensorial : familiar with size, shape, form, relationship in a series. Grasp the abstract materialization of the sensorial area. Made choices and distinguished from long from longer, thick from thicker , judge and observe , compare and classify
- Eye and hand , fine motor coordination have been increased.
- Before formal math area introduced, child needs to be introduced to practical and sensorial areas. 
- It helps the ability to abstract concepts.
- Meet mathematical ideas in concrete form first.
- Urged by the Horme, guided by sensitivity period, 
- Absorbs into unconcious mind, impressions and stores them, laying foundation in work of math.
- Very early age, manipulates place value and decimal system, games with mathematical operations.
- Is abstraction maths - 
- Child works operations in concrete forms first, manipulating and connecting hand to work. The essence of operations is clear.
- CASA has seven sections:
	- Numbers from one to 10
	- Teh decimal system
	- Linear counting
	- Operations
	- Memorization
	- Passage to abstraction
	- Fractions.
- Sensorial experiences and lays sub conscious foundation for concepts of quantity, concept of more or less. Number systems and hirerachies of numbers up to a million.
- Each group of mathematical study: occurs a pattern of 3. 
	- First material is presented in concrete form. (Quantity)
	- child is introduced to the symbols (numerals)
	- Associate concrete quantity with the abstract symbol. (Quantity and symbol together)
- Works at own pace to work abstractly at their own level.
- Great deal of difference between children to move to abstraction.
- This is one of the reason why work of the child in CASA is individual and each child is allowed to progress at their own rate.
- Each group of mathematics, child is introduced to the concept. And other material and lesson available that differ In form but not in concept. (Gives necessary repetition to assimilate concept)
- parallel exercises providing sufficient repetition.
- First introduced to 1 - 10 :
	- Number rods, (borrowed from seguin)
	- whole globally
	- New rods are added. 
	- Sequence of counting
	- Slowly and dont rush (to be )
	- Symbol to sound paper.
	- 10 is not on sand paper. 
	- Only 1 to 9 and zero is introduced later.
	- Comes realization that with just few numbers infinite numbers can be made. 
	- Association of symbol and quantity. 
	- Solidify sequence of numbers
	- Prep for 4 operations
	- Spindle boxes. (Meaning of zero)
	- card and counters (even and odd prep for divisibility)
	- Memory games
	- Ensure understanding is there and then decimal system is introduced.
	- Decimal system : simplification of numeration 1 to 9 and understand place value.
		- Base 10 - 1 through 9 
		- Requires solid knowledge of 1 - 10 and zero in order to be introduced to decimal system.
		- Teens numbers
		- decimal system if no interest in teens.
		- We follow the pattern of 3, where we start with the quantity alone, using concrete material of golden beads, then the child is introduced to the symbols.1 - 9000 in isolation with large decimal cards, after that child is introduced to the quantity and symbol together.  That is the formation of numbers
		- Linear and skip counting exercises ( run parallel to to our work in decimal system.)
		- Teen boards and 10 boards introduce the nomenclature of those lessons. 
		- Chains solidify the knowledge of the transition between the tens. 
		- Introduced to multiple of numbers indirectly
		- Skip counting  helps us understand different interval of change. By 5 interval vs by 7.
		- Operations: 
			- putting them together (addition and multiplication)
			- Separating from each other (subtraction and division)
		- first via collective exercises. Then with more symbol and less concrete stamp game, dot game to gain additional facility with exchanging when adding.
		- Memorization: math facts and tables.
		- Can learn facts easily and effortless (absorbent mind) not in elementary
		- It is difficult at elementary.
		- Passages to abstraction: pass from concrete to abstract,introduction to small bead frame for addition and subtraction, know the arithmetic tables in order for these lessons to function in the way they are intended.
		- Takes into millions
		- Large bead frame and then racks and tubes division (one unit divisor)
		- Fractions: from whole number , introduce parts of numbers, common fractions from half to tenths. Comes later in the casa because they need a foundation understanding of whole numbers
		- Equivalence of fractions and notations of fractions
		- Add and subtract with like denominators

- ### Mathematics in Second plane
- Mathematical mind continues to grow and be curious.
- Children should come into teh elementary classroom already excited about math.
- Not hard in CASA, 
- If children come with negative feeling we get them over it as soon as possible through small successes and positive reactions
- Receptive to understanding and abstraction based on imaginative and reasoning mind. 
- We have to present math not only as a subject of the curriculum. But as part of cosmic education and connected with all the subject areas. 
- Unfold the study of math by telling great story, (numerals)
- We begin study of arithmetic on day one. But story connects mathematics to humanity
- Instill in children gratitude. 
- Numbers can show a passage of time.
- Timelines and calendar connect math to the life of child.
- Math and language through word problems.
- Strong command of language for word problems. 
- Also accepting the law order pattern are the foundation of mathematics. 
- Study of poetry involves metrics and rhythm
- Geometry and study of line and arithmetic connection and form and algebra in derivation
- Expand understanding before numbers.
- Excite child - win cooperation of child.
- Thirst for knowledge
- Singular regularity (peaceful rest)
- No great transformation, (peaceful growing)
- Power and mental strenght (work and mental application)
- write own math problems.
- Prepared examples should be very limited in teh classroom. (Holds back the child and limits the work)
- encourage the child with own examples.
- If problem is beyond ability , either child will figure it out or ask for help.
- Have to help children know how to create their own problems and allow reasoning power to work.
- If understands the basic formula the reasoning mind with extend it. But will only happen if there is a culture of exploration. And work in your environment.
- we still begin to concrete information allowing for clearer concepts, must remember it takes manipulation and repetition to come to understanding.
- Every child might need varying type of repetition.
- Variety and amplification.
- keys necessary to understanding but are geared towards a CASA. 
- If is not exposed to casa, not interested and engaged. (Fading characteristic) caught up to that which will appeal. We delve deeper into exploration of numbers. We hope the child comes with good understanding of operations. We meet the child where ever they are in their learning. Get them up to speed. 
- What else we can do with multiplication, long and geometric multiplication.
- Not necessarily multiple numbers but also categories.
	- Multiples of numbers
	- Laws of multiplication
	- Least common multiple
	- Prime numbers
	- Natural series of numbers (squares and cubes)
- All variation of multiplication.
- Powers of numbers
- Powers of 10 and exponential notations
- Division:
	- Long division
	- Two types: difference between measurements, group division 
	- Partitive or shared division
	- Ability to choose correct method.
- Foundation of fractions and go beyond and go into decimal fractions
- Square root and cube root
- Positive integer and negative.
- Must keep in mind the connection of mathematics to cosmic education.
- Fractions - baking. Practical application for math
- Measurement in 1, 2, 3 dimension
- Study of algebra
- And derivation of formula

- Mathematics in third plane of development:
- Over arching goal , how she can integrate into and contribute to society at large. 
- Practical application, of math to a variety of vocations from artists, to writers, carpenters etc.
- Economic independence, adolescent seeks. - micro economy and hostel designed to provide practical application of mathematics and give them experience of profit , loss etc in tangible way
- Crisis of puberty
- Not a time for intense intellectual study.

- ### Conclusion

- Natural interest in law order and pattern and capitalize on this interest. Integration of mathematics across the curriculum.
