Need to establish a culture of handwriting where all children are writing regularly and consistently.

No workbooks, worksheets or journaling but factual imaginative writing, the going out, the practical life. All of this supports for writing practice. The booklets, the labels, the charts, the timelines. All of these are opportunities for hand writing. 

Guide needs to model careful handwriting in the presence of the children. Sit down and write a letter or a story in their presence. 

It is out of the common core.  

Important to write: automaticity in handwriting helps us to write better content. Meaning able to write without thinking about the formation of those individual letters. When we do that our attention moves to the ideas that we are trying to put on paper. 

Handwriting is our own and good handwriting can promote self-confidence. 

Writing by hand helps us to learn in ways typing does not. It helps our memory and learning. When we write by hand, we select key information and we process it. 

Typing is easier to record but we do not process that information the same way as we do my processing information by writing. 

Set culture in the classroom that we write about what we love , about our interests, handwriting should be a part of daily life of every child. 

Writing will take many forms and formats depending on interest and skill of the children. From single word labels to lists to sentences, to paragraph

Every topic can provide some opportunity, some chance for writing. 

At the very basic level we can ask the children to sign their name for attendance each day or write a reminder note about something or post the day of the week. 

Children can collect the lists of verbs in the future tense. Can write what foods are grown in Caribbean. 

How does our class meet the need our fundamental needs for clothing in April. 

They should rarely be practicing handwriting because they have so many opportunities within the prepared env.

By generating ideas and content and certainly practicing their letter formation. 

Even older children can struggle with hand writing... because they are more interested in big ideas, studies, and not necessarily the order of the written work. 

Collect handwriting beginning of the year and in the middle etc so that the child can see how their writing has changed over time. 


**Introducing Letter Formation:**

Every cursive letter starts on teh same line in the same place.  Grouping similar letters child gets repetition. Also repetition with variety. Give verbal cues to the child. 

No tracing over dotted lines... if those things are not their they are then lost. 

Introduce the simplest in the group of similar letters.

Make the letter in the air, with the child standing behind you. Motion with your arm. (correct orientation)

Second period repetition... guesses which letter you made in teh air. Third the child makes the letter and you guess. 

Variation: writing on chalk boards, sand tray etc. 

Writing tray

Correct letter movement will support the child the most.(repetition is important)

If they dont have to worry about holding the instrument correctly all the time. 

Variation: have them practice sounds and names of the letter.
Or have them explain how they are making the letter.
