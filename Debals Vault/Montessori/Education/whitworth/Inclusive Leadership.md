Inclusive Leadership Scholarship Application for the Montessori Program

Candidates for the Inclusive Leadership Scholarship embody the Mission of the School of Education.  They have experiences and backgrounds that enrich the program by ensuring a diversity of perspectives and experiences. The Inclusive Leadership Scholarship for the Montessori Program is for those candidates who are able to demonstrate their ability to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion in the classroom, with their cohort and in the community.

Please answer the following questions to be considered for the Inclusive Leadership Scholarship for Montessori.
1. Describe how your diverse experiences and/or identities (racial, ethnic, gender, age, ability, socio-economic, religious, generational, and other expressions of human difference including personal background and cultural experiences) have shaped who you are today and informed your pursuit of a master’s degree in Montessori?

**The perspective of someone who has experienced bias based on an individual's race or ethnicity differs substantially from those who have not. My parents migrated from Pakistan to the Middle East, where I grew up as a Muslim belonging to a minority sect. 

**I witnessed firsthand the discrimination as a child not only in school but also in society. When reminded of my faith, colleagues would treat me as an untouchable. Adults, however, feared losing their jobs, being deported, and spending months in jail for a different belief system. This unjust treatment of minorities continues to exist to this day. 

**Upon moving to the United States, I and many others have been victims of racial bias. Extra scrutiny at airports based on appearance, nationality, or profiling based on name existed before 9/11. 

**However, living in the United States has its perks. First and foremost, every human being has the right to express themselves freely. I have since been part of social justice movements at a personal level. While I have no classroom experience and more administrative experience, I had emphasized to staff the importance of acceptance of all individuals in society. I intend to learn how to incorporate ABAR/JEDI practices into the classroom. Hoping to learn, evolve, and play a positive part in achieving global peace and justice.**
