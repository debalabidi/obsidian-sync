## Human Tendencies Notes


- Dr. Montessori's educational aims: {page 1}
	- to help development of the child. 
	- to help adapt himself to the physical conditions of his environment and the social requirements dictated by the way of life of the group of people among whom he lived. 
		- adaptation: meaning happiness, ease and the sort of inner equilibrium giving a sense of security to the child. (stability plays a great role, what happens is the environment is not stable, war etc.)
		- psychological play between his experiences in the family and those he partakes of in his group leads the child to build an adult individual. 
		- Adaptability is based on permanency of the spiritual, ethical and economical equilibrium of the group environment in which his family both lives and has a very determined social standing. 
	- Insecurity leads to great harm in mental health. Mental health is based on the mental equilibrium which stands securely upon solid pillars of very determined values that will guide the individual in its every day behavior. {page 2}
- Help to development of children after 6 {page 2}
	- after absorbing the immediate environment of the casa and the restricted society and the family dealings, the guide must try to give the child what he now longs for:
		- the understanding of the world.
		- how it functions
		- how it affects the life and behavior of humanity. 
	- Simple notions are not sufficient. It needs to be presented in such a way that the child is able to absorb it not in the absorbent mind sense but in a way that will allow him to incarnate the world. Just as he was able to incarnate at a different level / perspective in the 1st plane, the incarnation of the immediate environment. 
- God appreciation should not be just via telling , it should be experiential in nature. {page 8}
- Real world experiences cannot logistically be brought into the classroom, the world is too large. {page 9}
- Anonymity of generosity.  {page 11}
- One of the characteristics of human tendency is that it does not change. It is universal in nature. 





Quotes: 
	- When confronted by situations which concern the child and seem difficult to solve, do not seek outside remedies, but concentrate upon the nature of the child and the essential needs of his development. {page 2}
	- One must go behind the curtains of outer behavior and reach something that is deep and basic and creative. This is true for children of all ages. {page 2}
	- We must give the children not only the world, but also a clear picture of 'mankind in the world'. So: a) "how the world functions" and b) "how mankind is affected by the functions of this world" 
	- Base yourself, upon the fundamental facts that do not change, no matter what the ideology is at any special historical moment, or how often - through the course of history - ideologies change and by doing so sway men to pursue different channels. {page 3}
	- What are the "needs of man" and how mankind fits in with the rest of life. And also: how mankind came to occupy its present dominant position. If one considers these things together one sees that behind the apparent disunity which exists in the mind of men, there is a continued and unbreakable unity. One realizes that mankind is not the abstract factor impersonated in the ideologies, which, as a sort of God, looms beyond and above everything else that has been created. The human kind is one of the many organs that function in a far greater organism, which we might call the "cosmic organization." Without the rest mankind could not exist. That means that man depends, for his life, on everything else that has been created.{page 3}
	- ... Among the different components of the world an interdependence that makes it all one unit. So much so that if one of these component items came to lack, the rest, as matters stand today, would cease to exist. Considering this form the religious viewpoint one also begins to see one of the aspects of the marvel of the creation of God: How God has arranged matters so that each expression of creation is of service to the rest. {page 4}
	- ... one finds something strange: that in every case there seems to be an apparent egoism, which masks the hidden reality of service. 
	- The way of working of God: To arrange matters so that even when one is being egoist to the utmost, one is still being of services to the upkeep of something else which exists in its time; or prepares the conditions for something unknown, which is to follow. And this is a beautiful realization. And this is a beautiful realization. Once the eyers are open to it, one sees more of this correlation and feels even more deeply the marvel of this aspect of God's creation and the harmony that this unconscious love brings with it. {page 7}
	- One cannot help but feel thankful to God and be strengthened in his faith. And if teachers make this realization accessible to the child - not in the way I put it to you now, but in such a way that he can really absorb these facts - he feels appreciation towards God to a remarkable degree. Actually, "how clever is God," were the words of an Indian child who had gradually come to grasp the wonder of this universal relationship. He said: " How clever and how good God is!" That was the spontaneous conclusion he had arrived at.  {page 7}
	- page 8 - first paragraph more on God's appreciation. 
	- ... to give the children "the keys to the world"; "the children should have an experience of their own with the world, so that they learn to appreciate it and the people living in it."  {page 9}
	- if we educators do nothing to make it possible for the child to build for himself a basic behavior by incarnating the stable realities hidden under the chaotic appearance, he will not find it easy to grow feeling confident in life. {page 14}
	- There are certain basic factors which do not change. What may change is the contents that you give the mind. It is these factors that make the child become adapted to any society, no matter what its pattern of behavior.{page 15}  (reference to learning to talk based on environment and acquisition of language)
	- Tendencies do not change and human tendencies are hereditary. The child possess them as potentiality at birth, and makes use of them to build an individual suited to his time.  {page 16}
