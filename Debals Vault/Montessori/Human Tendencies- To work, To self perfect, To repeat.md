### Introduction: To work

Abstract idea was not enough and had to transform into a concrete.  

Drive to fashion with the hands the imagined object. Hard work was necessary. 

Even after basic needs met, man still works.

Hands are the expression of teh intellect and of creative thought. Man created artifacts and architecture and symbols of spiritual aspirations. 

Long after man is gone, architecture remains as a testament of mans intellect. 

Activity is quite obvious in the young child. It seems that work and life are exactly the same at this stage in development.

It's the use of the hand that develops the mind body and spirit of the child. 

When the child is working purposefully, he is establishing new patterns of action and thought.

Work is a natural part of the human experience.

#### Second Plane: To work

As the child begins to explore beyond the classroom environment. He begins to understand the work that's happening in the world around him and to develop gratitude.

If we give the child an opportunity to explore, you will find he has a different respect for the world and for all of the work done by human beings. 

All work deserves respect work is necessary and it is of value. 

We dont think of work as a bad word in our  environments. 

Work is the way we can contribute to ourselves and our own learning. It's how we can contribute to our community and to the world at large. That's why we work to make a contribution. 

The child must be offered opportunities to work in a meaningful purposeful way in order to construct himself to the fullest of his potential. 

We know that the child is interested in big work.  So we give opportunities to dig deeper, learn more and explore that which interests him.

When he's interested we know the child will work tirelessly  to satisfy his curiosity and gain the desired knowledge.

	`Mario pointed out - it is enforced work that tires them out, but if one can assimilate the work spiritually that is work in such a way as to satisfy the spirit, work becomes play and one feels stronger, happier and more rested.` 


### Introduction: To self perfect

When the tool that man sought out to make via hand,  did not meet the exact idea in the mind, man made that tool again and again. Each time striving to reach more closely the perfection of his mental image. 

As we progress and evolve man repeats, hones and revises his art unsatisfied until he meets a certain degree of perfection. 

Along with the tendency of **self perfection comes exactitude,repetition and control of error**.

**Exactitude** is necessary fo the reality to conform to the idea in the mind. 

**Repetition** is observed, in the mans willingness to repeat until exactitude is reached. 

**Control of error** allows for the human being to check himself, and evaluate the level of self- perfection reached.


`In order that a tool or implement should correspond exactly with the purpose for which it was intended it has to be constructed with exactness. Through experience man was led by repetition to a realization of the need of an exact technique. The work of his hands, directed by his intellect called for self control leading to an integration of mind and body resulting in the realization of his idea - Margaret Stevenson`

### Introduction: To repeat

#### First Plane: To repeat

Easy to see the tendency in the young child in action. Repeat for as long as he wishes. And then feels satisfaction

#### Second Plane: To repeat

Craves repetition in a different way. Like to repeat through variety, or amplification. 

Mans minds reaches towards logical thought, and mathematical precision. The child in the prepared environment works with carefully sequenced materials ordered with a beginning , middle, and an end. This helps develop logical , rational patterns of thought in the child.

Points of interests are interspersed throughout the lessons, and they appeal to the  child's exactitude.

Exactness is an attraction to things, that are precisely so, we must be precise or the answer will be incorrect. We must be exact, or what we create in reality will not conform to the picture in our minds. This is closely linked with the tendency to repeat for the human being will work tirelessly  to come to exactness and children when allowed to do so will self-correct in an effort to reach self-perfection.

This allows for the solidification of concepts in his mind and his own understanding. 

The development of the will is closely linked to the human tendencies to self-perfect and to repeat. Self control was essential for a man to have success in adapting to his environment.

In Montessori classroom we see this is closely linked to work because, you only have an opportunity to control yourself if yourself is actively doing something. 

The tendency to control the self is why the silence game and walking on the line are satisfying activities that engage the children of the casa. 



### Conclusion

Universal tendencies are constant for all human beings, regardless of age, geography, culture, time. These propensities present themselves differently in the four planes of development, but they are ever present dusing the time in which the child is building himself into the man he will become, there are psychological characteristics which guide the human tendencies. Although these tendencies might look different throughout the four planes of development, they are present and must be supported and nurtured.

The prepared environment must respond to the  psychological characteristics of the plane of development and must support the expression of the human tendencies in order for it to offer the child an opportunity to construct himself fully and with confidence.
