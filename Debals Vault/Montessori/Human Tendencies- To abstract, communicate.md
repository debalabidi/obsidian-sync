### Introduction: To abstract

The tendency to explore, orient, order operate to meet our material fundamental needs of humans. However, human beings had no natural protection and there was and there is a need for clothing and defense, shelter.

Animals have instincts to build a home that suits him. Different birds build different types of nest, all is based on the instinct of the animal.

Man does not have that instinct, therefore man has to imagine what is needed and then make it.

Early humans imagined the covering of a furry animal on their backs to protect them from cold, they had the ability to envision themselves using a tool similar to an animals claw to dig.

**Abstraction:** is the ability to imagine or picture a material thing in its absence.

An ability to abstract combined with the use of the imagination is what allows man to transform his environment. 

Human beings have since the beginning fulfilled their spiritual and material needs. As they have met their needs, they have created a structure above nature.  

Dr Montessori calls this **supranatura**, and what she said was contained in this superstructure is everything, every invention, accumulated knowledge, all human beings have created for all time.

The ability to use the imagination in a creative way depends on past sensorial experiences. We do not create something completely new. Instead we create from our own experiences. 

Abstraction is to understand something with the mind, even if it isn't present in a concrete form.

In order to be able to think abstractly, we take tangible ideas and apply them to other aspects in our surrounding. The development of the ability to do this, is dependent on previous activities and the functioning of the other tendencies.

If the child is free to explore, orient and order in his environment, the mind will naturally abstract.




#### First Plane- To Abstract

Infant makes abstraction when after hearing the parents voice by repeating over and over again a certain noise which we would call it a word, but for baby it's just a noise your making. But over time i am eventually going to associate that with the object and the environment that the adult is making. 

#### Second Plane- To Abstract

The human being has the inherent ability to abstract. We work toward further abstraction in the elementary. As the children get older they have more experiences, more information, more sensory input to rely on and so they have a greater ability to abstract, because the foundation of the abstract learning is the concrete experience. 

When ideas and concepts are presented, we begin concretely  and move logically through the steps to abstraction. 



### Introduction: To communicate

Desire to communicate with other human beings led to the development of spoken language.

language is a tool in its own right. It hastened the split of man from nature. 

We can suppose but we dont know that perhaps language began in the form of gestures and body language and then some sounds to accompany the gestures. 

In order for culture to develop, there must be some form of language, and language takes agreement. We have to agree to meaning in order to have communication with one another. 

		`Not only does it fuse men into groups and nations but it is the central point of difference between the human species and all others. Language lies at the root of that transformation of the environment that we call civilization. However, intelligent men were,this alone could not produce the deliberations and agreements between them which are necessary for achievement. Language is an instrument of collective thought.-Dr Montessori

Need to communicate with those not present in the immediate environment led to the development of written language. 

It is the immediate society and culture that the human being is born into that will determine what language he speaks and writes.


### First Plane: To communicate

Tendency to communicate can be seen in the young child. Has an insatiable thirst for language.

Child exhibits a physical independence when he begins to walk and a psychological independence when he begins to talk.

The child's hunger for words is fed by the prepared environment. 

Enters CASA  with words from home, and then increases his vocabulary through nomenclature associated with the sensorial experiences within the prepared environment.




#### Second Plane: To communicate

Humans have a tendency to communicate and form a cohesive group. Humans want to belong in their society and be able to impart information to one another.

Human beings have a capacity for language and language gives the human beings his voice in society both figuratively and literally.

Society is based on structure and order which must be communicated. Cooperation and collaboration also depend on communication. It is only through language,that human beings can communicate their needs, wants and desires thus communication allows the individual to take his place in the group.

The child possesses a great sense of justice, admiration and compassion. He is developing his conscience and trying to decide for himself, what is right and what is wrong.

Beyond the academic aspect of language,  There is that which is part of the spiritual growth and development of the child. This development is key for the child to be able to navigate in society. The child must understand the reasons for things but also take responsibility for his actions and his words.

It is our hope that this child can understand the impact of the words that he chooses either in speaking or writing and the importance of representing who he is to the rest of society.

Communication is necessary to transfer ideas, so to truly be oriented to the world around him, the child must understand the impressions and assumptions that are made based upon correct use of language or lack thereof. 

The child will only truly come to this understanding if he's allowed to practice communication within the prepared environment.
