for observation we'll have this short lecture and you'll have two articles that are longish but good to read and a video to watch and then we're going to do some exercise some exercises that i'll explain when we're in person and they'll carry over into our time together there is an observational component that's required for this work too and so um we'll talk through that together when we're in person observation through her scientific objective observation of children dr montessori developed what we now refer to as the montessori method of education observation was the basis and foundation for everything dr montessori did with children and for each of the lessons and materials that are still presented on ami training courses it is only through observation of
children that we can connect to the theory that we are learning to our practice in the classroom our task as adults in the classroom is ultimately to prepare an environment where the child's needs are met this allows the child to construct himself free of obstacles to his development but in order to do this we must observe the child not just the work the child chooses but the child as a whole observation is part of the guide's work each day in the classroom because it's only through observation that the guide is able to present the child with lessons expectations and guidance that allows for self-construction if we objectively observe a child and base our actions and our plans on that observation then we can meet the needs of that particular child observation coupled with an understanding of second plane characteristics is what guides the teacher to guide the students
observation is a skill it's a skill that we have to practice and hone and refine it has to be done in the moment because if we're making what we're calling observations after the fact that's not a scientific observation we're recalling our perceptions of what happened instead of notating what we see in front of us observation must be practiced and perfected it must become an intrinsic part of who we are as adults in service to the child we learn to observe without being obtrusive or invasive and always with respect for the child and the work he's doing to construct himself dr montessori said those who observe children must not disturb them because the purpose of observation is to see what the children are doing independent of our presence i'll read it again
those who observe children must not disturb them because the purpose of observation is to see what the children are doing independent of our presence in fact dr montessori called upon us to observe children to be still and silent not just within our bodies but also within our inner energies and our feelings  and she referred to that as our souls so your body and your soul has to be silent and still a key skill to work on developing when it comes to observation is that of objectivity ideally you should be able to look at what's happening without prejudging the situation or assuming the outcome this takes practice but it is essential to true observation at times your mind will jump to a conclusion or an assumption and we have to be able to recognize that and then set it aside and this can be achieved through our conscious will we have the ability to do that we can set aside our personal experiences watch objectively and take in the information occurring before us it can be difficult to be objective but it can also be well worth working for it is only through objective observation that we truly see the child not as we expect him to be but as he is at that moment an effective observer has to learn to be patient we have to learn to observe many phenomena that seem to be uninteresting until something of interest does occur we never know when that moment will happen dr montessori emphasized the need for the adult to not be distracted by the actions of one child thereby neglecting observ observation of the rest of the children and this is an important skill and it takes practice and further we have to be careful of the language we choose to observe the children we must try to factually and objectively represent what we seeand we start by choosing what it is we want to observe that's the subject of our observation and we start by describing what we see and you try to record what you see without prejudice without judgment you don't write what you think is happening that's an interpretation instead we observe with love willingly and with real interest and we have to see through this lens of love for the child because that's the only way we truly are conveying our interest and respect for what's in front of us we see everything as new as if it never existed before because that allows us to liberate ourselves from personal preference we want to be alert and attentive of what's happening to train our mind and bodies to work with our eyes so that we can be concentrated and consistent and able to have an outcome of what we observe for our outcome to be scientific observation must be exact objective and ordered it must also be constructive and respectful responsible and without judgment it has to be without emotion and it must be from a place of humility and love we're making observations without conclusions without interpretations or assumptions or expectations observation is not right or wrong it just is what we see and for that reason we never correct our observations or transcribe

our notes

right when we do written observation we always have um at the beginning the date the starting time the place the weather our physical state as an observer and if it's in a sequence of observations what it what number it is in the sequence we also can say what aspect we're observing for [Music] or the reason for the observation if there is one and then what time we're going to end our observation so all of that's at the beginning of the page and then every 10 to 15 minutes you write your time in the margin of the page to track your time

as you're going through your observations and then you write what you see and we'll have practice with this together as a group scientifically objectively observing children is the cornerstone of our work the teacher can know the lessons and the order in which to present them there can be a beautiful prepared environment created with care and attention to detail the teacher can masterfully tell stories to children every day all of those things can be happening there can be going out happening but it's only when the trained adult implements implements practiced scientific non-judgmental observation that you are truly able to know the child and that she's able to meet the needs that particular child has in order to construct himself to his fullest potential
