- Story can lead to study of Biology, History and Geography (interconnected)
- Story is not completely factual and not completely fantasy (a mixture of both fact and fiction)
- Whether it is true doesn't really matter. What matters is that life came as an answer to a problem, that life is necessary. In order for their to be harmony.
- By highlighting the interplay between life and the environment - way to show a 6 year old that life is a part of the process that started all the way back into the creation of the world. Everything has a set of laws to follow
- Human beings too came to earth and we too must follow our laws.
	- Personifying the elements of story:
		- Air , water, rocks and the sun (appeals to imagination , dramatization)
		- Emphasis the laws of each.
		- We have our rules to follow
		- Give the framework to the child to put things in place.
		- We talked about once life came that all sorts of experiments happened ,By attaching for each life form the idea
			- Instinct for survival
			- goal of achievement
			- What it needs to survive and its contribution to others. (though unconciously)
- We dont want them to grasp that such and such animals in a particular period, but more so the contribution of a particular life form and its contribution to others
- Purpose is not what happened when, board big framework on the importance of life. 
- Importance of life on earth and the preparation of coming of human beings.

#### Practicalities of the story

- Sit on the floor with children gathered around you. 
- First part of the story you are telling the story and there is no timeline. 
	- Adapt to your environment and the children.
	- It is ok to break down the story into two days depending on your situation.
	- Timeline can be shown the next day. 
- Reading the book of the earth that we begin to unroll the timeline.
- Unroll as you are talking gradually (applicable to story of coming of life and black strip). Unlike other timelines which are completely unrolled.
- You dont want to give too much where there is nothing to explore for the children.
- It's ok if every single tiny detail is not covered.
- Do not over load the story with tons of new names. (Those scientific names are for further study not for the hook that we are establishing)
- Give major ideas and milestones in the story:
	1. Unicellular life arrives. ()
	2. Multicellular life arrives and had organs
	3. Invasion of land. (completely and partially out of water)
	4. Seas cut off and water dries off in some areas. (Reptiles, skins and lays eggs)
	5. Coming of birds, eggs with hard shells , cared for young better than reptiles
	6. Mamminals (cared for young and handle cold well)
	7. Finally, Inequiped creature came, no feathers, no claws etc but had love and intellect. (If humans arrived anytime before, the earth was not ready for humans)
- We want to use mystery and drama to get the children interested. 

#### After Story is told
- After you tell any great story you want the children to have time to sit and reflect, we are not going to ask them follow up question, assign work, prove that they were listening. 
- Great stories are offered to the children, to provide them a framework and let them think about something that is big. To struggle with a little bit.
- If the children have questions, you don't have to answer questions, or you can give short answers. If the answer is complicated, you say its a story for another day, write it down and address it later on. 
- After the story , keep the timeline out for a couple of days, walk by and notice something (both children and adult), model for the children. Take it down and put it away.
- Blank or mute timeline... (its a working timeline, they are not matching, )
	- Matching timeline - is there a developmental and intellectual work being done? As a teacher you have to evaluate it. 
	- Designed to be used at a distance, either full timeline rolled up, isolate one area, across the room, memory training valuable for executive function.
	- They can check their work. 
- Have some resources when they seek information. So you can direct them about this time period. Older children, what is teh current scientist think to get them interested?
- The role is to invite the children to an area of study and to connect cosmic education to itself and to connect children to cosmic education so they can see themselves and recognize themselves within the wonder of the world.
