### Introduction: Tendency to Explore

The tendency to **explore** allows human beings to gain information.

The first humans/Adam had to explore the earth in order to find, food, shelter and clothing. 

We had to find what was needed and experiment with it.

The first humans would have explored and experimented with the environment to figure out how to successfully function within that space. 

Via exploration and experimentation the humans discovered that some plants were delicious and nourishing and some are dangerous.

In order to satisfy his hunger , man had to **explore** and **adapt** to the world around him. 

Humans were able to meet the need for nourishment and we can surmise that some human being had to sacrifice themselves in the process. 



#### First Plane: To Explore

Human baby is born with the tendency to explore. The raising of the head. Absorbing everything around him. 


#### Second Plane: To Explore
- Does not have the absorbent mind and more of an imaginative explorer.
- Via reasoning and active imagination to explore beyond what is infront of him and is no longer limited to what he can physically experience with his 5 senses
- Exploration drives a child to examine in order to make a discovery.
- Often will explore beyond his knowledge taking either the right path or another path but either way he will be learning from his own experience and efforts.
- constantly exploring both with and without materials.
- We provide for this by exciting the child, igniting the imagination and offering the freedom to investigate that which is interesting.

### Introduction: Tendency to orient

The precondition to exploration is that man needs to orient himself to the environment.

Orientation is the ability to put yourself in relation to and navigate your environment. 

Early man had no map no compass, however he had the gift of intelligence and his human tendencies to guide him. 

Human being has the power to have information reside in the mind to instruct the reality in the self. 

#### First Plane: To orient 

Reaching out to grasp things, that's him bringing this into his own world and understanding.

Insecurity arises from lack of orientation. Meeting the tendency to orient allows the child to **adapt** to the new environment and to the world around him.

Through power of absorbent mind the child acquires language , culture, customs, mannerisms,  likes, dislikes all of this enduringly lovingly and this orients the child to the human beings around him. 


#### Second Plance: To orient 

The child is a social being and orientation is how this child determines his position in society physically, politically, spiritually.

There is also a psychological orientation where the child orients himself to how society operates.

To orient is to learn your way around and orientation even to the society can provide security for the child just like it can for you and even for all human beings, the more oriented we are the more comfortable and confident we feel.


### Introduction: Tendency to order

Man needed to orient himself to go out and find where he was and where he might need to go to meet his needs that we see the tendency to order.

Human beings needed to sequence their journey from beginning to middle and then end.

Classification and organization of what was observed is what allowed the human to fully act on his environment.

Early man observed, recalled, compared, cataloged and classified information in order to understand the phenomena around them.

#### First Plane: To order

Order is nearly as essential as air and water for the child.

Need to find stability and order in the world, so that he can then find himself within that world.

We can see that young child is upset by disorder.

``The sight of something out of place seems, to represent a kind of stimulus a call to activity but without doubt it is also something more. Order is one the needs of life which  when it is satisfied produces real happiness. Order consists in recognizing the place for each object in relation to its environment and in remembering where each thing should be. This implies that one is able to orient oneself within ones environment and dominate it in all its details. - Dr Montessori

Young child must make sense of the myriad impressions he is receiving in order to find security. The structure of the prepared environment with a place for everything and everything  in it's place meets the need for order in the young child. 


#### Second Plane: To order

Orientation and exploration lead the children to more information then they ever had before. 

The child needs a way to organize all his thoughts and ideas, so he is inclined toward order.

However, the child does not have the same sensitivity to external order. That was a characteristic of the first plane but not so much in the second.

The child in the second plane is intellectually ordering an immense amount of information. If we insist that during the process of work our elementary children keep everything neat and tidy and orderly, it will slow down the work to the point of the child losing interest.

The child is no longer sensitive to external order when working, so we accommodate his psychological characteristics and we allow for it to get a little bit messy or a little spread out, but we also accommodate the society, the community in which we are working every single day by returning our work and materials neatly and orderly upon completion.

Routine and predictability are really important ordering tools for the child. 

It allows the child to make predictions and assumptions based on his experience and they strengthen teh developing reasoning mind.


### Conclusion

The human tendencies toward orientation, exploration and order are ones that are focused on the most as the child first enters the classroom.

It allows the child to gain security and confidence within the prepared environment and therefore support him in constructing himself to his fullest potential.
