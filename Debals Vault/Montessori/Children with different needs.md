Children in your class with different needs:

- Ellens personal view ... when was little .. life story.
- Adolescene viewpoint - have them create the world that they want. rather than get ready for the existing world. 

- Is everybody safe? Psychical and emotionally safety.
	- if the child said i would kill you. How can you plan for something like that. Consider not letting that child be in the classroom. 
	- some children might kick but no one was going to be harmed. potentially but still not hurt so make a call based on context. Maybe the parents are very cooperative. 
- Shelton Training:
	- target the most annoying thing as a guide. So that you are calm. 
- If the child needs individual attention: then perhaps 
	- medical issue the adult could intervene
	- discipline issue guide is responsible. 
	- train on how to talk to people.
- What would you say to other children that have special needs?
	- parent permission would be needed only do this in extreme circumstances.
