# Chapter 1 - The Successive Levels of Education

In Montessori, the planes of development correspond to the successive personalities of the child. The method is geared towards the natural characteristics as demonstrated in different ages. These characteristics themselves include several levels. There is a parallel between the life of the insect and that of the child. However, the changing qualities are not so visible in the child as in the insect. Hence Montessori referred to it as the "rebirth" of the child. 

Points:
- The different ages could be compared to the metamorphoses of insects.  When an insect comes out of the egg, it is very small and has a particular form and coloring. Then, little by little, it is transformed even though it remains an animal of the same species having the same needs and habits. It is an individual that evolves. Then one day something new happens. The insect spins his cocoon and becomes a chrysalis. The chrysalis in turn under goes another slow evolution. Finally the insect comes out of the cocoon in the form of a butterfly. 
- In effect, we have before us at each new stage a different child who presents characteristics different from those he exhibited during preceding years. 
	- First level of education applies to the small child from birth to about seven year of age. Since a number of transformations take place during this important period, we have established the following sub divisions:
		- The first two years.
		- the years from three to five.
		- the sixth and seventh years.
	- The period from seven to twelve years - the period immediately preceding adolescence may also be subdivided. It is on a different level than the preceding period. If the changes produced during the first period are considered as growth, it may be said that veritable metamorphoses take place during this one. 
	- Twelve to eighteen years: one could say as much for this, the period of adolescence. 
	- In each period we rediscover a growing being, but one who is a quite different person every time. 
- Only a thorough analysis leads to the discovery of the changes that occur continuously in the child, who grows until he becomes a man. It is precisely these changes that have the greatest bearing on the method of education. 
- Example:
	- When the small child begins to feel a loose tooth, it is a sign that the first period of childhood is over. This event occurs without much fanfare within the family. When the tooth becomes very loose it is pulled. A certain amount of fuss is made: the tooth is saved, and that little ceremony constitutes the first step of a new period in the life of the child. It will take a long time before all the baby teeth are gone and the child acquires his new teeth. 
	- But if unluckily, it is necessary to pull one of the new teeth, more will be needed than merely a silk thread; we will have to deal with the extraction of a strong and fixed part. Loss of the baby teeth is only one among the many manifestations of this age. 
	- All these traits - physical as much as psychic - constitute the links of the chain which is the metamorphosis of the child. He is both stronger and slimmer. His hair is less lovely. Psychologically, he is less gentle, less agreeable.
