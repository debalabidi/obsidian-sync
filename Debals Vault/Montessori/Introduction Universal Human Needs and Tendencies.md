Natural development of human beings via observation came to the conclusion that there are universal human tendencies that unite the child with all of mankind.

`The human tendencies provide the theoretical framework for the implemented Montessori curriculum at any level of the child's development.`

**Tendency** is defined as a natural urge or impulse that leads with conscious design or reason to certain actions.

Tendency may be both physical and spiritual in nature. The tendency is the manifestation of the nature of man independent of time, geography or economy

**Fundamental needs of Human beings** is defined as, What human beings need in order to survive. 

All human being share certain fundamental needs both material and spiritual.

Material needs are essential for survival for physical self. Example:

### Conclusion

Human tendencies are present throughout life, although they are ever present they manifest themselves differently during the four planes of development. This is because they are guided by the child's psychological characteristics during a particular stage in life.

These human tendencies provide the theoretical framework for the implemented Montessori curriculum. 

Because we provide an environment and the tools for the child to construct himself we must always allow for the human tendencies to be fully operational in our classrooms and its our job to remove any obstacles to free the expression of the tendencies.
