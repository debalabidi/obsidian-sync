	Lets come back together now. 

	Did you notice that when i can bethanys name only she came. and each have a name, does this have a name? what about this,and what about this. 

Pointing to a plant and then tissue.

	I have an assignment for you, walk around the classroom without disrupting anyone very serious work. I want you come back when you have found something that doesn't have a name. lets see who come first with something that does not have a name.


	It seems like everything that you guys brought back has a name. Let me give you another special task. Walk quitely around the room without disturbing any other children and bring me... go.. bring me... oh i am sorry i didnt tell you what to bring, You bring a cube , you bring a shell , you bring a pencil , now can you bring what I am asking? Now you can. 

The children return

	You brought a shell, how did you know how to bring a shell.  because i asked you to breing a shell. exactly right.. ask each child and invite them to return items and come back. 

	Names , names are very important. Did you know that the egyptians would give two names to every baby born. There was a public name and a private name and they thoguht that if other people knew the real name it would give power over that person so that was a private name. Thats how powerful the egyptians saw  naems to be so interseting. I have a lot of stories about nouns and names of things for you.
