SCHOLARS | COMMUNITY MEMBERS | ADVOCATES
EFFECTIVE PRACTITIONERS | VISIONARY LEADERS

Mission
The Whitworth University School of Education prepares socially-just and inclusive teachers, counselors, therapists, and administrators to be educators of mind and heart who are scholars, community members, effective practitioners, visionary leaders, and advocates.

Vision
The Whitworth University School of Education provides opportunities to integrate theory and practice in diverse settings through the study of established and emerging content as well as through pedagogical and professional knowledge.

SCHOLARS possess current knowledge of the content areas in which they work, understand the connections between disciplines, use tools of inquiry, and pursue ongoing learning as existing fields of knowledge evolve and grow. Scholars are innovative and strengthen their existing knowledge base through continuous intellectual and scholarly growth based on current research, study of their own practice, analysis of data collected, and application of data to solve problems in their respective fields of study.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS develop and sustain intentionally collaborative relationships among colleagues, students and their families, clients, administrators, and community partners. Community members understand their roles as professional colleagues in schools, communities, and professional organizations. They actively help to shape the culture of classrooms, schools, and agencies to reflect the values of our democratic society. They model respectful, caring, and professional behaviors that foster trusting and inclusive environments.

EFFECTIVE PRACTITIONERS are prepared to analyze situations, set goals, plan and monitor actions, assess outcomes, and reflect on their professional thinking and decision making using formative and summative data. They are committed to culturally responsive and relevant practices that are engaging and shape purposeful, continuous growth. Effective practitioners demonstrate proficiency in the selection and differentiation of materials, strategies, and assessment practices that are appropriate for the diversity of the individuals they serve.

VISIONARY LEADERS articulate a vision and philosophy for their professional practice inclusive of a belief in the worth and ability of each human being. They build a framework to guide personal and professional decision making and development for the benefit of their professional and learning communities. Visionary leaders contribute to society by modeling transformational and servant leadership that emerges from their personal beliefs and worldview perspective.

ADVOCATES demonstrate a sincere and equitable commitment to the social-emotional well-being and physical safety of those they serve. They pay attention to the role diversity, including gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, race, culture, religion, and socio-economic status, brings to learning and the community. Advocates understand and respect the inter-connected, global nature of society and encourage sustainable practices designed to preserve our world for future generations. In the Christian tradition of servant leadership, advocates seek opportunities to assist, encourage, and support all those under their care in a manner that leads to transformation in the lives of those they serve.
