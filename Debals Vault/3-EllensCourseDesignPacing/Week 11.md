**This week we are focusing on Biology>Botany!** 

You will see that I have filmed much of this outdoors. Of course, if being outdoors is not possible (perhaps it is winter, etc.), then you can do similar work within the school so long as you have lots of plants available. 

Please note that the leaf videos were filmed in 2020 during the pandemic so they are a bit old, but they do reflect the work (I just hadn't fully developed my method of filming videos at that point). 

This week, please start with the plant and the leaf. In upcoming weeks we will do the stem and the roots (the vegetative parts of the plant) and then the flower, fruit, and seed (the reproductive parts of the plant). 

Mario Montessori was so fond of this work--he felt that when children know and can name the aspects of the plant world, then the children feel like they know the plants as "old friends." Even if you feel like you don't know much about the plant world, you will learn a lot through this work. 

For the leaf, the main assignment is to make a flow chart of the presentations. You will be most successful if you watch the leaf videos and also the "how to make a flow chart" video. I have provided my draft flow chart for your reference, but you must make your own. 

They do have to be hand-drawn, but you can do the hand-drawing on an iPad or other tablet if you want. The idea is that you will make it by your own drawing skill even if it is digital (this is not a "do the activity as the children would" kind of assignment). **What you cannot do is use clip art or other internet drawings.** I'm ok if you trace them (tracing can be very educational and uses the kinesthetic memory), but you can't substitute internet or other people's drawings for your own. 

**The other area you will explore is art and handwork.** We will explore one of many aspects of art and handwork that can be coordinated with botany work--crayon rubbings!

You will also access the introduction to botany--please do watch the video as well as read the handout. You are asked to do a reflective activity about botany. We will talk more about the work in botany at our upcoming online meeting on July 17th (4 pm to 7 pm Pacific time). **See you soon!**
