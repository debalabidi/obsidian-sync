The work for this week is "a little bit of this and a little bit of that." 

In geometry, you will experience the **Story of How Geometry Got its Name**, some presentations about **fundamental concepts in geometry** (point, line, surface, solid), further exploration of congruent, similar, and equivalence with the **constructive triangles**, and the beginning exploration of **circles**. 

There are also some music activities, including the beginning work with the **tone bars** and some information about **singing**. 

For art and handwork, there is some information about **book arts**. There is one document to read and some videos to watch and books to make. The books are not due for another week (so you have time to get supplies for them). 

I hope you enjoy the eclectic variety--of course, in Cosmic Education we can find many ways to connect it all!
