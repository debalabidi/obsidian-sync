**This week we are focusing on Geometry and some more multiplication.** 

The polygon work is very interesting--**please try to watch all of the videos in the order shown below**--it will help in the "unfolding" of the ideas presented. 

After the children have the concept of polygons and know triangles and quadrilaterals, we explore the sum of angles in those polygons with them. 

The Sum of Angles of Polygons work is very interesting! The very first activity is perfect for younger children. Older children who have done the "reasoning" level of other geometry work will enjoy thinking about the "proofs" of the ideas. 

Note that some of the assignments are presentation summary cards, but **some of the assignments are "experience as a child." Please read all of the instructions carefully**--usually these have you do the work as if you were a child (using paper and pencils and/or colored pencils, etc.). 

**If you do these "experience as a child" activities as directed and submit them by their due dates, they count toward "supervised practice hours."** We schedule in regular assignments like this which ask you to practice something and we have allotted a certain amount of time for supervised practice for them. 

I look forward to seeing you all online on the 17th of July! Please reach out if you have questions. 

**The new work for this week is:**
