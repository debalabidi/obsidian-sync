This week we will continue our exploration of Montessori theory topics. **_Please access all materials before the date of our discussion (Wednesday, May 8th)._** 

**Scroll to the bottom of this lesson to see important due dates**, including some on Monday, the 6th. Please note that all assignments are due at 8:30 am Pacific Time on that due date. _**Remember to set your Populi time in "settings" to the local time where you physically are in the world--then Populi will adjust all due dates/times to your local time so you won't miss a due date.**_

The focus for this week is on the foundational Montessori work in our Theory Album. The topics for the week are Human Needs and Tendencies and the Planes of Development. 

Please both listen to and read the lecture materials. The documents will become part of your theory album. 

Note that for the lesson of the "First Plane of Development," it is a very long lesson with many "pages" in Populi. We will only be discussing the first four of these pages this week--the rest will be part of a later discussion. You don't have to access all of the pages of that lesson now, just those first four parts (listed below). 

I look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday. _**Please come prepared for discussion--we will have some whole-group discussion and we will also be in some break-out groups.**_ Please reach out if you have questions or need help navigating anything.
