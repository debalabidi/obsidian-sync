This week we will go back to Geography. We are finishing the chapter for Composition of the Earth with the Further Details of the Composition of the Earth as well as the Formation of Mountains. 

You will see how the further work with three states of matter (especially rigid, elastic, plastic solids) can assist the children in understanding these geological processes. 

I recommend getting some books for your classroom (and yourself) about the "roadside geography" of your location. In the US and Canada, I recommend the [Roadside Geology series](https://mountain-press.com/collections/roadside-geology). The books are great for helping you understand the geology of your region so that you are able to show the children the local geology in action and also bring children on excursions to places of interest. 

It is also great for the children to explore the book on their own to see places they may want to visit as part of a Going Out. 

The work in Geography is not "one and done." If you are working with older children (in the 9-12 class, for instance), it is important to revisit all of these earlier presentations and dive more deeply into them with the children. Remember that the first time it is presented it is more of a general exploration and learning some new ideas and vocabulary. Later, the same presentations can be revisited to dive more deeply into the details and the specific geological processes. 

I hope you enjoy this work--the children really love the geography presentations!
