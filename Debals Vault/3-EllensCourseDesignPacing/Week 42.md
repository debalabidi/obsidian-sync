This week we will be building upon the work with squaring by doing the work with cubing. I know for the work in the course this is all coming one after the other. For the children, remember that this would should not be done pedandically, but be presented as something interesting to explore--some activities for mental gymnastics. 

We will also do a bit of exploration with music with the scientific exploration of sound. These are little experiments that we do with the children and have available for them to explore the different ways that sounds are made and how different variables change pitch (string length, length of columns of air, etc.). 

Exploring sound in this way is very interesting to the children and ties into so many other activities. Pythagoras, for instance, spent a lot of time experimenting with pitch and there is a type of tuning called Pythagorean tuning. There are many stories about this to explore. 

We have class on Wednesday, March 26th. Our topic will includ a history wrap up--synthesis and review and more. We will discuss the last of the upcoming history work. See you on Wednesday!
