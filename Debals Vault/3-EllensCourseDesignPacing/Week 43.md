**This is a week of finishing work in several areas.** We will start with some of the work in history which we discussed in class last Wednesday.

We will revisit the First Timeline of Humans. There are two associated assignments with this first timeline. One is to make a summary card of the initial presentation, and the other is to write and tell a short sample story about one aspect of the timeline. 

For the family tree of hominins, we will revisit this work that we did this summer and you will do some work to learn more about the topic and the various hominins. 

For the study of civilizations, you will read over the handout. For the Study of the Child's Own Country, you will read over the handout (not yet published, but coming soon) and also read an interesting article. You will prepare to do a project in Spokane this summer where you will work in groups to make a timeline. 

For language, we will explore the Study of Style--this work can be so interesting for the children and is something that you can come back to over and over through their six years in the 2nd plane environment. This type of work can also be used by the children when studying their own writing style and as an aid to writing. 

We will also be exploring, in language, spoken language and poety in the classroom as well as exploring the important topic of bias in literature.

The assignment for bias in literature will take some extra time and so the due date is a few weeks out, but **do read the lesson and the assignment this week** as you will need the time to prepare and **you won't be able to do it successfully at the last-minute.** 

There are also some theory topics to explore. These, too, have some extra time (not due next week), but you are advised to read the lesson this week even if you wait the extra week to do the assignment. 

So, a bit of a hodge-podge of topics, but all very interesting and with a wide variety of assignment types  (including some "read and confirm" types) and some extra time for some. Enjoy!
