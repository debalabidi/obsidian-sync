It was great to see you all on Wednesday!

This week we are finishing the work in our biology albums! You are doing it! We are at week 39 of 57 weeks of the content-part of the course. We are well past the halfway point!

One part of the work in Human Biology is making a shared resource of books. Please note that I specifically cite that you can look at libraries and used bookstores. That means that some of the resources are out of print--that is ok! If you find a helpful book, gather as much information as you can about the book so people can search the "corners" of the web to seek out used copies. I've found that some of the best nonfiction books quickly go out of print, but are worth searching for. 

We will also be working with the introduction to history. 

The next due date for missing work and corrections is in Mathematics. **Volume I work** (introduction to mathematics through, and including, decimal fractions) **is due on March 17th at 8:30 am Pacific time.** Please see the table of contents to know what is included in volume I. This is the same type of due date that we recently had for geography. All past due missing work and previously identified corrections for mathematics work that would be in volume I of the albums must be submitted by the due date above by 8:30 am. After that, we won't be looking at the volume I work until the end of August and mathematics volume I albums won't be able to be submitted in time for graduation. To clarify, if there are new corrections identified for work newly submitted or newly resubmitted on or before March 17th, there will be a new due date for those corrections. 

Please see the list at the bottom of this page for all of the upcoming due dates for work for each album. You have been making great progress and wrapping up each album's work will be very satifsying for you as well as get you in a great position to put all your albums together and prepare for this summer of practice, synthesis, and review.
