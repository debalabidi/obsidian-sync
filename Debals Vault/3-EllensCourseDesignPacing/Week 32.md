**This week we will focus on two things--geometry and reading.** The independent work you do will be about geometry. You will explore the further work with equivalence with the inset materials. You will also explore circles beyond the initial nomenclature. You will do some explorations of the concept of Pi and also begin our work where we help the children extract formulas from their experiences. This week, we will focus on extracting the formula for circumference. 

I think this is such an interesting part of the work we do in Montessori education. In a traditional setting, we give the children formulas and show them how to plug numbers into those formulas to get them to work. 

Montessori, though, has a totally different approach. She talks about the formulas coming from the children themselves after long experience. It is almost like the children are "discovering" the formulas and it is much more exciting! 

We will also be exploring reading. A lot of the work we do in reading is incorporated into other areas of the classroom. Below you will see a link to the lesson for "commands and nomenclature." This will bring you to a lesson which will include botany, geography, zoology, geometry and more. Please please please read the lesson carefully and do it in the order suggested. _**Be sure to watch all of the related videos and read all of the related documents. The assignment is not due until the 27th, but you will need time to watch and read everything and to integrate the information.**_ 

Our topic for our class next week is reading and literature. I'm excited to discuss this important topic with you!
