Botany work permeates the 6-12 classroom--inside and out. There are discussions and discoveries all of the time. Lunch time is a great time to explore who has roots in their lunch, who has stems, who has leaves, who has seeds, fruits, flowers, etc. 

I love to do this work outside whenever possible (I love to be outside with the children). You will see that, as much as possible, I tried to film the videos outside as well. 

In addition to the botany work, we will also _**revisit common fractions**_ (see note below). This is work we already did in Spokane--nothing new--just a review and the assignment for it (which apparently I forgot to post earlier).

Enjoy!

We did this already "live" during our time together, but I realized I had not made a due date for the assignment. I've added some old videos that I had for this work to remind you of what we did in person. Please do watch them to remind you of the work before you do the assignments.
