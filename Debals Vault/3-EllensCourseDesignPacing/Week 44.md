**This week was supposed to be written exams--now moved to July.** 

**No online classes this week!**

I'm so excited to share the "First work" with square and cube roots with you this week. Often people think of square and cube roots as concepts reserved for older children, but the work this week will allow you to experience that the concept of square and cube roots is actually quite simple and even young children with minimal prerequisites (basically, they need to have had the concept and notation of squares and cubes of numbers--very early work) can successfully do this work. 

The work with signed numbers is similar. The first handout is early work which can be done with children who are quite young. The second handout can be done with children at two levels--the children can do the operations experientially, using the materials, to "see" whether an answer should be positive or negative. As they gain experience, they can spontaneously "discover" the "rules," or, if with a lot of experience it isn't happening spontaneously, they can be slowly guided to the discovery of the rules. 

We are finishing up a bit of language work here this week. The calligraphy video has been filmed and I aim to edit and post it by the end of the weekend. 

With the art and handwork, we will be making a traditional tool used with dip pens and calligraphy pens (not due for a few weeks). That video, too, is filmed and should be edited by the end of the weekend. 

Enjoy this week!
