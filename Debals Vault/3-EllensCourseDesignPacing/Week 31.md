Happy 2025 everyone!  

We will ease back into the course after our break with some language work. We have an upcoming class on the 15th which will be devoted to language work, including discussion of reading, literature, and more.

The Fundamentals of Literacy part 2 will be discussed at our class and you will be able to fill in the handout at that time (it is due the 20th).

For the Interpretive Reading Cards, there are two videos. One is the required video of me presenting the Interpretive Reading Cards to you. The second video is optional (but highly recommended). It is a video of a Zoom call with a previous cohort who had specifically requested that I go over the IRCs with them "live." You may find it helpful to watch that video as we actually get to do them together and discuss them a bit further.

For the parts of speech-further work, we are starting the work with verbs. English has a lot of verb content! My suggestion is to ease into the work but keep up. Don't put off doing these assignments. Please do look over the notes for the adult. It is ok if they are a bit more than you can digest at the moment--just look over each page and get a feel for what is there. Then start the work for the simple tenses part 1, the auxiliary verbs, and then simple tenses part 2.

I'll endeavor to get you many of our Tables of Contents by the end of next week so you can start organizing albums.

See you all on the 15th!

The "Christmas cactus" (Schlumbergera) in full bloom in my office. Schlumbergera is from Brazil--the flowers adapted for pollination by hummingbirds. In the southern hemisphere they tend to bloom in May, but in the northern hemisphere are more likely to bloom in November/December (hence the common name).
