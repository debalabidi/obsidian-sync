It was so great to discuss spelling and puncutation and reading and writing in general with you over the past months and during Wednesday's class last week. I think that we can produce amazing writers when we develop a supportive culture that centers the children's spontaneous activities and also their own self-construction.

This week we will be doing a bit more language work, with more explorations of written expression, history of language, and then our introduction to language. We are close to wrapping up our language work for our album! There are just a few more things after this week to explore before we are done. 

A lot of the assignments due on the 24th are "listen and confirm," "watch and confirm," and "read and confirm." There are a few assignments that are making examples or having experiences as a child (including based upon work we did in class a few weeks ago about writing). The introduction to language will have you outline/mind map and then reflect. I hope you enjoy this week's immersion into language!
