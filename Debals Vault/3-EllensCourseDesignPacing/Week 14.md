This week we have two things happening--new work in mathematics for your asynchronous work and also an online session on Wednesday, the 7th.

The focus of the online session will be botany work. We will do a brief overview of the work in botany, then you will break out into groups to practice presentations with each other. 

**Please be prepared with some broadleaves that you have collected** (and/or houseplants that have broadleaves). 

**Also come prepared with flowers with which to do a flower dissection**.

This will required advanced planning so please don't wait until the last minute. _**You can only get credit for the supervised practice time if you come equipped with leaves and with flowers suitable for dissection.**_

For leaves, you will want some variety of leaves based on their veins and also based upon if they are simple or compound.

Flowers suitable will have visible and somewhat prominent reproductive parts (stamens and pistils). It is ok if you need to have several different flowers in order to access all of the parts, but you need to have enough flowers to demonstrate all of the parts (stamens, pistil, corolla, calyx) and be willing to dissect them (don't choose a houseplant whose flower you don't want to cut up). A combination of roses, lilies, tulips are easy to find, but be prepared to spend some time looking for flowers at a flower shop and/or your own or a friend's garden. This is what we will do as teachers so it is a necessary and useful activity to do now for practice. 

Also _**come prepared to give the lesson about the main function of the leaf, parts of leaves, some of the varieties, and the main function and parts of the flower.**_ Both the main function of the leaf and the main function of the flower have stories that go with them, so please be sure you have both watched the video and also have read the handout and done the associated assignments. Coming prepared and participating in the activities will count toward your required supervised practice. 

Please be sure that you are not in transit or otherwise occupied during our online classes--_**online class attendance only can count if you are fully participatory as if you were in-person**_. 

We will be splitting up into groups and doing presentations with each other. 

In addition, new work for this week will be introducing category multiplication as well as the work with squares and cubes of numbers. Because we are going to be so busy with collecting flowers, I've changed some of the previously posted due dates for the work and have pushed the category multiplication due dates ahead one week (so they are due on the 19th instead of the previously posted 12th).

The category multiplication is a great activity for solidifying understanding of multiplication. Generally this is for older children who have reached the stage of using the traditional algorithm to solving multiplication problems and want or need a new challenge. There are some children who will do this in the younger elementary class, but most children will encounter this in the older elementary class. 

The work with squares and cubes of numbers is definitely for the younger children. It sets the stage for so much work that the children will do later. The very beginning work can start when the children are new to the 6-12 class (at six years old). The end of the work in this chapter generally happens around seven or eight at the latest (though some children may go more quickly through the work). 

**I look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday and going over this fun work with botany with you!**
