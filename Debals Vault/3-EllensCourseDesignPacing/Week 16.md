The focus of this week will be art and music, with a little math thrown in for good measure! _**In the Montessori 6-12 environment, music and art are an inherent part of the everyday work of the children**_. We don't (or shouldn't) relegate these activities to special classes and special teachers. Even if your school requires this, _**all of the regular classroom teachers should be presenting art, handwork, and music activities within the classroom with the children**_ regardless of what is happening with the specialists. 

Integrating art, handwork, and music into the everyday work is imperative for achieving what Montessori saw (and what I experienced in my work with the children) was possible--that the children were able to self-regulate and spontaneously choose activities and areas of exploration that supported their self-construction. _**Art, music, and handwork are integral to the human experience and have been since the beginning of human history--they should be part of what is available to the children on a daily basis.**_ 

This week we will explore some basic techniques in watercolor (with so many more techniques to explore later) as well as some early work with art theory (making a very basic color wheel and exploring primary and secondary colors). We will also explore the background of music we hope the children have had in the 3-6 class with the bells--this background is important before we go more deeply into the work with the tone bars. You will note that I've added a "test" as one of the assignments. 

This music "test" is to help you engage with and be attentive to the important details of the bells work that are important in later study of the tone bars. It is an open book test--you take it _**after watching all of the videos and reading all of the written materials**_ (and you can have these things open beside you while you take the test). Two retakes are allowed--more details will be found in the lessons. _**Even if you feel totally insecure about the work in music, you can do it!**_ Take it one step at a time--go in the order indicated below--and you will surprise yourself with how it all builds on previous knowledge and makes sense. 

_**The work in math is with the laws of multiplication.**_ This work starts early and is meant to give the children concrete experience with two important laws of multiplication. _**The first is the commutative law of multiplication**_ (sometimes known as the commutative property)--the idea that in multiplication, the order of the operands (the multiplicand and multiplier) doesn't matter--the product will be the same. 3x7 and 7x3 yield the same result. 

_**The second law we introduce is that of the distributive law**_ (sometimes known as the distributive property) which shows that when multiplication involves sums (addition), each component of the multiplicand is multiplied by each component of the multiplier. That sentence makes it seem much more complicated than it is--the handout and video will show what all of those words mean in a much simpler way! 

_**These two important laws are revisited over and over**_ throughout the children's time in the 6-12 class, so this work starts early with some very straightforward experiences with the materials and then progresses through more symbolic and "reasoning" activities as the children build experience. 

**I will be available until August 23rd and then I'm taking a break until September 6th.** You will hear from me again on September 6th (the next Friday letter) introducing the work for the week of September 9th. Enjoy your break!
