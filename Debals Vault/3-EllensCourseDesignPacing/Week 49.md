We have mostly mathematics, art, music, and some theory topics to complete now. This week we will take on the introduction to geometry (as a follow up for our discussion in class recently) and powers of numbers. 

As with so many of our mathematics topics, especially these last ones that we will cover on the course, they are offered to the children as interesting explorations. They follow the same kinds of patterns we see with all of our math. 

The first activities can be presented to younger children who have just the minimum of prerequistes. For the introductory activities with powers of numbers, these prerequisites are understanding the concept and notations of squares and cubes of numbers and basic concept multiplication. 

Often I see people wait until the children are in upper elementary to present powers of numbers, but this is not correct. Most children can be presented with at least the first part, "introductory activities," while they are quite young and certainly in the lower elementary class. Some of the later work is more conceptual in focus or requires more facility with numeracy, but the first activities are quite straightforward and the materials guide and support the activities. 

I hope you enjoy this work with powers of numbers--my experience is that when presented in the right way at the right times, the children are quite excited about exploring these ideas.
