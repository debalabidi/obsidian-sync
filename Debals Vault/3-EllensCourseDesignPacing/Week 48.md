This week we will be doing cube roots--the final two steps. 

You may find that this work is much easier than you think--once the children have done square root with the pegboard, the cube root with the cubing materials (and then, for three-digit roots, with the hierarchical trinomial cube) is a quite straightforward type of puzzle. 

Please do think of this work (square and cube root) as a sort of puzzle and don't get too pedandic with this. **We are offering the children interesting explorations of the world of mathematics.** If we can keep that attitude--one of exploration and solving interesting puzzles--then mathematics is a fun and engaging pursuit. 

I hope you enjoy this work with cube root!

This week we have class on Saturday from 8-11 am Pacific Time. Our topic is going to be geometry. We will go over the introduction to geometry and touch on many geometry topics. Since I'm still in Taiwan it will be 11 pm to 2 am for me, but I'm planning on spending my Saturday in my apartment working and napping so that I'll be fresh for you all!

See you Saturday!
