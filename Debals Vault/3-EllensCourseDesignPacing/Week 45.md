This week we will be exploring geometry! We will be doing some of my favorite work--that of exploring Pythagoras' and Euclid's theorems about right-angled triangles. 

This work follows the beginning of the "further work with equivalence work" and then the activities in the two chapters work parallel with each other. 

The work starts with sensorial experiences, then moves onto the "reasoning" level and then onto the abstraction level and the "creation" of a theorem and formula. There is also an exploration of ratios embedded in these activities. 

We will also be exploring the start of the chapter about the geometry of solid figures. This will include a handwork exploration as well. 

I hope you enjoy this work--in my experience, the adults' excitement and interest has a strong impact on the children's excitement and interest. There are so many interesting experiences here--enjoy!
