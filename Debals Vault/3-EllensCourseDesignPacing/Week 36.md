**This week will be a geography wrap-up week.** We will complete all presentations in geography, discuss the overall work in geography, address human geography topics, and talk about geography as part of Cosmic Education. 

**We do have a three-day online module (Monday the 10th, Tuesday the 11th, and Wednesday the 12th).** 

I'm still making videos for some of the human geography topics (last year I did them "live" on Zoom only), but I'll also be going over things via Zoom. There will be time during class to collaborate on some of the assignments as well. 

On Tuesday, the 11th, I anticipate that Alice will join us to discuss digital albums (I remembered and contacted her and I'm pretty confident that the 11th is the day!). 

**If you can look over the work for the week before we meet, you may find it most helpful.** I look forward to seeing you on Monday!
