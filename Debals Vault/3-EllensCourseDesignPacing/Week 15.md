**This week we will be going back to some geography work**. The last geography work we did was in Spokane when we did some of the work with nature of the elements: states of matter and also did the chapter about sun and earth. 

We will finish the chapter on the nature of the elements with different ways of combining; separation, saturation, supersaturation; and attraction and gravity.

We will also do the fourth great story--communication in signs. _**Within a school year, we try to get the great stories in within the first five or six weeks of the school year.**_ 

Of all of the great stories, _**this fourth one is the one that is often needing the most adjusting based upon the languages of the school and the children.**_ If there is one main language, do that story first. If there are other languages represented which use a different writing system, you can then do those as well with the children. 

There are different versions of this fourth great story even for English and you may find that your coworkers have a different version. _**There is not one "official" version--the story just has to contain some main elements.**_ You can write your own. 

Also, we want to be sensitive to children whose heritage include languages that may not have a written format and/or who adopted a written format only after other people came into their world and/or their culture experienced colonization by a culture which precipitated the development of a written language. 

_**The main elements include the wondering about communicating and then exploring the ways in which people tried to communicate symbolically (in the absence of direct person-to-person "live" communication) and then the stages of development of they symbolic representation of the language.**_ 

**The new work introduced this week includes:**
