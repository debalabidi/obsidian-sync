We will continue our discussion of theory topics this week, focusing on Imagination and also Great Stories and Key Lessons. 

Also, we will likely have some of the Whitworth folks coming to orient you to some of the things you will want to know about being on campus (both whether as a student on the course and/or also as living in the dorms). 

I'm going to start to open the other areas of exploration with you--you can expect to be added to the Geography, Art and Handwork, Language, Mathematics, Geometry, History, Biology, and Music courses this week. Not all lessons will be open to you, but some of the introductions and beginning work will be available. More will open as we progress in the work. 

Below, at the request of one of your cohort, I've made a list of what you may want for the course while you are in Spokane. 

I'm very much looking forward to meeting all of you in person in just a little over a week!

See you all online on Wednesday!

**The work to access for Wednesday discussion is:**

I was asked by someone in the cohort to provide a list of what may be necessary in Spokane. Here is a "off the top of my head" list that Yvonne and I came up with. It may not be totally comprehensive, but it is fairly complete.

- Notebook or other way to take daily notes in class. 
- Loose paper for making mind maps and other sketches that will become part of your albums. 
- Index cards—lots of them (anywhere from 5-10 per day, I think, for most days that we are in Spokane). Large ones are best. I think 5”x8” is best. Some people like color coded by subject, but I think that white “ruled” is best and most flexible—people can add a color coding to the white card if they like that. 
- Index card holder (there are many different ideas about what works best for people—each person may want to choose their method themselves). Some people like ones that have different compartments and expand, other like a box with dividers, some people live in Asia where you can easily get perfectly sized small binders specifically for index cards (what my Taiwan students tended to use). 
- Colored pencils—I always recommend high-quality ones (prismacolor, faber-castel, or other art brands). You don’t need the biggest set, but 12 - 24 colors are good (some brands allow you to buy individual colors—in which case I recommend picking up a silver and gold as we will use these for grammar work). We do have colored pencils in the prepared environment, but they are only for use during the time you are there (you can’t take them back to you room or apartment, which is where you will also need to use them). 
- Good eraser
- Regular pencils
- Pens (drawing and writing)
- Small ruler 
- Scissors
- Glue stick for making materials
- Yarn needle (can be metal or plastic). [https://www.joann.com/susan-bates-steel-yarn-needles-size-16--2in/2381507.html](https://www.joann.com/susan-bates-steel-yarn-needles-size-16--2in/2381507.html)    [https://www.joann.com/susan-bates-3-3-4in-luxite-bulky-yarn-needles/3318342.html](https://www.joann.com/susan-bates-3-3-4in-luxite-bulky-yarn-needles/3318342.html)   Longer is better, but any length will work. 
- Embroidery hoop—about 6” (wooden, bamboo, or plastic all work) [https://www.joann.com/6in-embroidery-hoop-by-big-twist/18759134.html](https://www.joann.com/6in-embroidery-hoop-by-big-twist/18759134.html)
- Some worsted weight yarn (small scraps of different colors/types). Worsted weight yarn is #4 on the yarn-thickness/weight scale (and in the US is marked that way). It is not necessary to have tons of yarn—if the whole group picks just three or four small skeins, that is likely enough for all 18 of you. I will have some available, but people may want to have different choices. Also, some knitter’s scraps would be perfect (instead of new skeins).
- Any other art supplies that people think they would like to use. 
- Red card stock for making some zoology materials (animal story material, animal question and answer game). I’m probably going to post the details for this before class on Wednesday. 
- A closed lidded water bottle and/or coffee cup for the lecture room. Has to have a lid.

In addition, everyone will need **a computer to access Populi**, for writing reflections and papers, etc. A **smartphone with a scanner app** (for iPhones, usually “notes” app has a scanner function) is helpful for photographing and uploading assignments.
