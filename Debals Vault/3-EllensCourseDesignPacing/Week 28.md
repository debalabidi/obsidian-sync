We return to class this week with biology. We are very close to the end of the work in the biology album and so now is a good time to do the introduction to biology. I know that usually introductions are done at the beginning (hence the name "introduction..."), but after some experience, I feel that the introduction is even better as a summary and so I like to do it more torwards the end of the work when you have a better frame of reference in terms of the types of activities we prepare for the children.

Please do give yourself enough time for the Classification work. There are many many videos for Kingdom Plantae and Kindom Animalia. Just the watching part will take a long time. Also, please do watch Plantae first as the work there sets the stage for the Animalia work. 

For the ecology work, be sure you have accessed the materials in advance of our online class on the 11th--we will be doing a practice that day in class and you will need to be ready to present to a group (we will form smaller groups in breakout rooms). Do check [the assignment](https://montessorinorthwest.populiweb.com/router/courseofferings/10738319/assignments/26161740/show) in advance so you know how to prepare. 

I hope you enjoy the work this week! I love all of the work that can take us outside--exploring the natural world!
