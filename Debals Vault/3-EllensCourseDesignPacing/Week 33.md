This week we are going back to Geography to explore **The Work of Water**. Water is an integral part of life on the earth and Montessori speaks and writes about water a lot. This week's work includes videos and readings from Montessori's books.

One of my cats, Ghoul, makes a cute cameo in one of the videos (I didn't notice him when I was filming--I only noticed when I was editing)! 

There is a material making assignment associated with this work (due in February). If you don't live in North America (or don't plan on working in North America) and you want to do this material making for a different continent, please let me know and I can help you with how to approach this. 

So many of these activities are done with things you may have in your household (or use charts) so please do try to practice them on your own. Actually preparing them and following it all through is a great help to having a smoother presentation when you are doing this work with children (as you may be asked to when you do practice teaching). If you don't have a river model available to you, it is easy enough to make a good-enough one just using things you can find outdoors (piling up rocks or sticks and making a "river" on that with clay and mud and sand). 

**We have class Saturday, the 25th** (8am - 11am Pacific Time) and will be doing more discussion of language activities plus have a guest speaker talking, for a short while, about digital albums. 

I hope you enjoy **The Work of Water**--the children definitely do!

**Saturday workshop focus:** Language activities, digital albums, and more...
