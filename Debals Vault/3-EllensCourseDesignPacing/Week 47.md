**This week we are finishing our last chapter in our geometry album!** You are getting **so close to the finish line!**

We will be exploring how to create a formula for volume and also exploring other polyhedrons. 

Only part of solids of rotation has a video--go ahead and do the work for all of it and I will demonstrate the rest of it when we are in Spokane this summer.

This coming week we have class on Saturday. We will be doing a synthesis and review of the work in geometry. 

Class is on May 3rd from 8-11 am Pacific Time. See you then!
