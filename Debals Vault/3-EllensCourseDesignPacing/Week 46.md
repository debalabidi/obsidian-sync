This week we will build upon the previous introduction to square root. The last work you did about cube and square roots was an exploration of the concept and notation and some beginning work with extracting square and cube roots in a very concrete manner. This work can be done by even young children. The main prerequisites for that early work are an understanding of the concepts of squares and cubes of numbers.

This week is will explore square root more symbolically. With the early work, the children could extract a root of a number, such as 576, by creating a square from the golden bead materials. With the more symbolic work with the pegboard, the process is similar, but instead of using actual units, tens, and hundreds, we will use pegs in the hierarchical colors. 

The guide squares are very important here as they guide the work and help the children see what categories are in play as the process unfolds. 

There are many steps--they will take place over a long time period so don't rush the children!

The children view this work as an interesting puzzle so be sure to keep your presentation in that spirit--something interesting about numbers to explore!

The other work we will do is to hear about and think about the work we do with the children overall, and also some special considerations for children in a 9-12 class (and the adults who work with them). 

I hope you enjoy the work of this week. Send questions our way if you have any--we are reachable by email. Enjoy!
