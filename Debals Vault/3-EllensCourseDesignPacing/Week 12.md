**This week we will continue our focus on botany with explorations of the stem and the root.** 

When you do the various demonstrations in the classroom, it can take some planning. In the classroom, _**it is best to have many of the supplies always on hand so that you can get these going when you think of them**_ rather than thinking of them and then having to gather the supplies (which often means that you put off doing them). Some of the supplies to have on hand:

- Potting soil in a moisture-proof bin (if potting soil dries out it can resist gaining new moisture, which is challenging as the "bits" will float when you add water)
- Peat moss or sawdust (used for "roots avoid light" demonstration) in a bin
- The various pans and containers used
- Seeds of various types for planting: corn, onion, beans (various, including some large ones), radish (or other fast-growing seeds),etc.
- Sections of a woody stem which have the bark intact (these can even be small rounds cut from the branch of a tree)
- Plants in the environment which have various types of stems. Most houseplants commonly found in classrooms have herbaceous stems, so try to be sure to also have something with a woody stem, like a ficus or a Norfolk pine, etc. 
- Watering can
- Small tools for scooping soil
- Trays on which you can place demonstrations to protect shelves and tables from moisture.

In addition to the botany work, _**please take the time to read the observation requirements fully as I want to avoid you having to re-do an observation if your observation experience didn't meet the requirements of the course.**_ The link to the lesson which describes the observation requirements is below. The "lesson" includes an overview as well as a description of the three different sessions. 

_**Please remember that you need to upload and/or send (depending upon the part of the assignment) your paperwork as you go along**_--don't wait until you have done all three observations! Also remember that _**you must get permission before observing in your own classroom**_. We need at least a month between the time you request this and the time we approve it. Whether or not you can observe in your own classroom depends upon being and remaining in good standing on the course (we determine this by on-time submission of assignments, attendance, accessing course materials on Populi, etc.). 

It was great to see you all on Wednesday! Our exams start today for course 11. We will be checking emails daily but our response may be very slightly delayed. 

_**See you all on August 7th!**_
