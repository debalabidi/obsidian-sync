Welcome back, everyone!

This week, in anticipation of our three-day online module (September 16, 17, 18 evenings in North America), **we will be looking at the first plane of development**. It is absolutely imperative that we explore the first plane of development in depth if we are to fully understand the children in the second plane of development. _**All of our second-plane children used to be first-plane children!**_

Many of you do have a 3-6 diploma--our explorations will be going over some key concepts of the first plane of development. Beyond what you did in your 3-6 course, we will be also highlighting how we build upon specific ideas and practices when working with second-plane children. 

_**Even if you work with 9-12 year olds, you will find this deep dive into the first plane of development very helpful--**_we will be exploring the important concepts and practices of how we work with the children and how this approach retains its basic ideas even as it adjusts and responds to the children's changing needs as they move through their development. 

It is important that everyone has accessed the materials before we meet on the 16th, so **be sure you allot enough time in your schedule to read all of the materials, watch all of the videos, participate in interactive modules, and complete one written assignment.** For the work due on the 16th, there is a lot of reading and video watching, but there is also just one written assignment. 

The assignment load for the following week (work due on the 23rd) will be greatly reduced since you will need to be online for 9 hours the week of the 16th. 

**For the week of September 9th, attend to the following areas:**
