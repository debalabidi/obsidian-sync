I'm sure by now it will seem like the math is never-ending, but it will end! We do have some last topics to cover and non-decimal bases are one of them. 

I first encountered non-decimal bases in eight grade. It must have been on some list of standards and I could tell that my teacher was not confident in teaching it and it was truly (even for me--a math nerd) tedious. I didn't even understand what we were doing--it was just a bunch of steps to get some answer that I didn't understand and didn't even know what it all meant. 

When I realized we were going to do this in my 6-12 course, way back in the 1990s, I couldn't imagine that this would be something we would do with 6-12 year olds. 

Well, I totally underestimated this topic. What we did was so clear that this work, especially the numeration and the conversions, is one of my favorites. And, it is totally understandable. 

So, take it slowly. Start with the numeration and you will see that even quite young children (perhaps older 7s and 8s) who have had some experience with squares and cubes of numbers and are confident users of the golden bead material can quite easily enjoy this material and the beginning activities. 

Older children appreciate the "brain-teaser" qualities of the other activities with operations and conversions. 

Perhaps you, too, will have some epiphanies about the nature of number systems. I hope you enjoy it!
