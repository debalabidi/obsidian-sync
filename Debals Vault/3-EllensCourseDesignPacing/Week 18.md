The real work this week will be our **online three-day module (September 16th, 17th, and 18th, 4-7 pm Pacific Time)**. The work listed below is quite minimal and you can probably get it all done in just a very few hours (it is not due until the 23rd).

I'm listing it now in case people are caught up on the work due by Monday, the 16th, and want to get ahead. If you don't get a chance to get ahead, no worries, this work is easily tackled in the days after our module is over--it is all reading and watching videos and a few of those online interactive modules. 

We will actually focus this week (when we are together) on the theoretical aspect of the first plane as well as the exercises of practical life and sensorial activities. 

We will start to touch on language and mathematics on Wednesday, but you can look over this work after that discussion. 

See you all on Monday, the 16th, at 4 pm Pacific Time!
