**This week we are working on Biology.** The materials you will access are mostly meant to give you information about some of the ways we approach this work with the children. 

For the "General information: Biology Nomenclature," take some notes somewhere that you can keep aside when watching the video--especially around the idea of how we use the nomenclature as a reading material. You will refer to the notes at a later time. 

For the "Introduction to Zoology," you are asked to listen to the lecture and reflect on zoology as part of Cosmic Education. Always we must be thinking of what we are doing with the children as part of Cosmic Education. On the training course, because we are preparing albums and materials and so have to organize in a logical way, we tend to identify each subject that we are doing (such as when I say we are working in Biology this week), but with the children we try to avoid saying "I have a presentation for you in Biology" and instead prefer, whenever possible, to say something like, "I have a story about animals for you..." or "I want to share something about plants with you..."

Also, we always want to center the idea that we are supporting children's self-construction, not just "giving them a lesson." Children tend to be very interested in animals and so the work in Zoology is an opening into helping the children's self-construction utilizing the power of their own interests. Please listen to the Introduction to Zoology with this idea in mind.

For the "Activities Preparatory and Parallel to Body Function of Vertebrates," you will be adding to a fillable handout. The assignment asks you to do a small amount of research as well (and you can collaborate on this assignment). The organization of the handout is meant to give you an organized way to think about and sort information about animals which can facilitate your conversations with the children.

The "Body Functions of Vertebrates" work happens parallel to these many small conversations we have with the children. I will have a digital copy of this material available soon (there may be one in the files already from a previous course, but it has been re-drawn recently to be a cleaner image) so you can make this for your classroom. 

We will also be visiting the Prepared Environment in our theory studies this week. Remember that in our Montessori triangle, the Prepared Environment is one of the three components. The lesson for the prepared environment contains a lot of information that can help you think about your environment and how to best set it up to support the children to work in collaboration with their second-plane characteristics and their self-construction. 

Our next meeting is on November 2nd. This is a Saturday morning workshop (Pacific Time). I'll be sending specific information next week, but you can count on group work and getting some supervised practice hours for participating. 

See you soon!
