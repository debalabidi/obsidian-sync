This week we will be **concluding the work with decimal fractions**. There are a lot of materials for multiplication--my advice is to take it a bit at a time, watch the videos but also follow along with the handout. The assignments for multiplication are not the usual presentation summary cards (there are some for multiplication, but not for every single presentation), but you will make a general outline for flow of work with multiplication and only three PSCs for multiplication. In addition, there are some material making assignments that you can use right away with the children ready for this work. 

Division has the usual PSCs.

In addition, **we will start with further work with parts of speech**. Even though we are doing this more than halfway through the course, in the classroom this work can happen very early for the children--as soon as they need it. The work with the number of the noun, for instance, can happen any time after the child has been introduced to the noun (and even before they have moved to other parts of speech). 

The next two weeks are course breaks and you won't likely get too many emails from me until closer to the end of the break. This break is a good time to work to catch up on missing work and corrections as the winter and spring always seem to speed by. Soon there will be some final due dates for missing work and/or corrections--I'll post them ASAP.

If you do have missing work, the best strategy is to always stay on top of current work and then start to take care of past-due work--getting some of that past-due work done each week. 

I hope you all have a lovely break and I'll be back in touch soon.
