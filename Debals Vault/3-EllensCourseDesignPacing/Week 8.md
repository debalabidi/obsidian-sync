This will be our last week together until next summer. We have a short week (just 2 days), but we will squeeze in what we can. 

We will be showing the first timeline of human beings--this will be the new version. I haven't posted the material as of Friday afternoon, but it should be posted by Sunday. You will be able to purchase a timeline either in the autumn (we will print some in time for my refresher course in September) or by next summer. 

You will access, on your own, the clock time work. 

We will finish grammar boxes this week as well. This is not the end of grammar, but just this first part of the grammar work. 

We will start the work with common fractions as well as some more work with congruency, similarity, equivalence.

Our next theory topic that we will start is the prepared environment. Please do watch that video before Tuesday (we will discuss it on Tuesday morning). 

See you all tomorrow (Saturday) for our practice session--we will be introducing the bank game at that time as well as giving you more practice time. 

I'll miss seeing you all every day, but glad we get Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday together!
