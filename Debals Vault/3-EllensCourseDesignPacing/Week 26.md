**This week we will focus on some fun activities for the reasoning mind!**

Children in the second plane of development love puzzle solving and analytic work. The work of this week is all about thinking, discussing, and exploring ways to classify and categorize aspects of the world (the natural world and the world of human-created language). 

It is too easy to become pedandic* in this work--whether it is about classifying plants or animals or about analyzing a sentence. I encourage all of you to take a different tact--instead of being too pedandic, try to approach all of this type of work as a big adventure and an exploration into ordering and classifying the world. 

The goal of these presentations is not to produce children who can accurately apply some specific classification and analysis scheme. _**Our goals are much loftier--to create a culture where children explore the ideas of classification and analysis--where they discuss and debate and try things and then change their minds and try again...**_

When you have a situation where children are discussing and even disagreeing with each other and making the case for how their interpretation is the one that should be used, then you will have succeeded on this path! 

Even though the work below may not seem related to each other (analysis of sentences and classification in biology), they actually work towards the same goals--**_activities for the children to think and contemplate, to apply their knowledge, to discuss and refine their thinking._**

_**There are several reading assignments this week**_. None of them are particularly long, but they lay the necessary groundwork for our thinking of how we work with the children. All of the reading materials are provided in the lessons except for one book that is on our required list, **Advanced Montessori Method Volume II**. You will need to find a copy if you don't have one so that you can do that reading assignment. 

I hope you enjoy this work and really get into the spirit of analysis and puzzling out and sorting and rethinking and...(I think you get the picture!). 

**This week we have a class on Wednesday afternoon, 4-7 pm (Pacific Time)**. Our focus will be on exploring Going Out. Last week there were some readings and videos, etc. about Going Out and this week we will take a deeper dive into this important subject. The link to the class will be on the dashboard of this Orientation Course. 

See you all soon!
