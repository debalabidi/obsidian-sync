This week we will be doing _**the chapter in mathematics about squaring**_. Just like all of our other work in mathematics, the very beginning work in the chapter is suitable for even quite young children. If they have an idea of multiplication, of squares and cubes and how to notate them, and the first presentations of commutative and distributive law, they can be quite successful at the first activities. For children who need more practice with multiplication facts, this work seems so much more interesting than just trying to straight-up memorize facts. The work involves doing lots of one-digit by one-digit multiplcations and is manipulative and interesting. 

The other work we will explore will be in the language album in the chapter "written expression." This chapter includes lots of activities for writing and language arts, but we will particularly explore, this week, _**spelling and punctuation**_. That will be the focus of _**this week's online meeting on Wednesday, the 12th.**_
