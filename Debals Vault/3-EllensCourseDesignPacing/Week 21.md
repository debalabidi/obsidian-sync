**This week we will be exploring human history.** What you may notice as we go along in the work with history is that Montessori takes a somewhat anthropological approach to history--it is not the study of specific conquests and rulers and such, but more of a study of how humans meet their needs. We study how people throughout time and throughout the world have adapted to their time and place and have also adapted the world around them as well. 

This week we will explore some of the ways we can think of people's adaptation and also their movements on the earth. These ideas are not specific presentations, but more of a series of conversations that we have with the children as they explore human history. 

We are also picking up on the measurement of time, this time moving beyond clock time and into the idea of the passing of days, weeks, months, years. This work is directly related to the sun and earth work in geography and there are so many cross-overs! 

I hope you enjoy this work--there are some projects for you to do as the children would do. They are quite enjoyable and I hope that you have fun with them. If you can, do them with children (their work will count if you are working along side them and it meets the needs of the assignment)! 

There is also a theory topic that I know will be interesting to you--Freedom, Responsibility, Independence. This will be one of the discussion topics for our next online meeting on October 16th. As you listen to the lecture, please write down your questions--I'll be setting up a way for you to submit your questions in advance of our class.
