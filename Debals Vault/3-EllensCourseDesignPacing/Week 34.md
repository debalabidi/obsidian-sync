For the upcoming week of January 27th, the focus will be on language work. Saturday, the 25th, we have an online workshop (see the "dashboard" for the link) regarding language work and our main topic of our January online class was also reading and language. 

The asynchronous work this week focuses mostly on the verb. We've done the simple tenses and work with the pronoun. Now we will work with other forms of the verb.

My suggestion would be to be sure to watch each video. Follow along with the handout. The progression of the work makes things quite clear. You will see that for the transitive and intransitive verb as well as the passive and active voice of the verb, it is necessary to use the sentence analysis materials. 

For the "other forms of the verb," we see the beauty of how the grammar symbols help the children visualize the "job" or function of a word based upon its context in a sentence. For instance, in the sentence...

_The sleeping dog snored._ 

...we can see that the action that is happening is snored. "Sleeping," normally an action, in this sentence takes on the job of clarifying "which or what kind of..." dog (the sleeping dog). So the word "sleeping," normally a verb, here is doing the job of an adjective. The symbol is that of an adjective (medium-sized blue triangle) but shows its origins as a verb (the triangle has a red circle in the middle). It is kind of like a verb wearing the outfit or costume of an adjective while doing the adjective's job. 

You will also see an activity for biology. It is both an observation activity as well as a general activity for cosmic education. You will watch a Montessori guide video, take observation notes as for any type of observation of children. As you observe, though, take note of all of the various skills being honed as the children go about doing this work with snakes. 

See the assignment for the activity--it describes the kind of brainstorm you will do. The activity is meant to help you think about how to use the children's interests to support them in developing skills in many different areas.

For our workshop on Saturday, please bring loose paper and pencils and scissors. Also, if possible, bring some **non-fiction** children's books (picture books are fine, or reference books) about topics that children are interested in. It isn't necessary that every single person bring a book, but so long as some people do we will be fine. 

See you Saturday!

This is one of the last biology activities you will do for the course (other than submitting your animal story materials and your final corrections and album).

At our January online classes we will be/have been talking about literacy in the Montessori 6-12 environment and how we utilize all of the children's interests and explorations to further their knowledge and skills for literacy. The children's interest in animals is also key in helping them develop skills in other areas as well. At this late point in the course (we are well-past the halfway point) your skills of observation are more attuned. You will be watching these videos with an eye toward identify how the children build skills through pursuing work that interests them. The goal is to help you see that we can use the children's intersts as a way to help them build skills in other areas.
