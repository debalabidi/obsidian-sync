This week we will have a "light" week. I didn't get the rest of the Non-Decimal Bases Operations videos done (for multiplication and division) so I'm pushing that due date until June 2nd (for just the "operations" PSC). 

This week, please read the document for measurement. Confirm that you did so. 

I'm in Spokane--it was our first day here arranging the new environment. It is going to be so beautiful! We have moved to a different building and the space is amazing--so much light, low windows, and the lecture space and practice space are in the same room (one on each side). We are thrilled!

It is still in its not-fully-unpacked stage, but by tomorrow afternoon we expect it to be nearly completely set up. Woo hoo! 

Enjoy your weekend and week!
