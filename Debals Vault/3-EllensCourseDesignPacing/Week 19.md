**The work this week will focus on mathematics.** 

**The early work with multiples and factors can happen very early in the 6-9 class.** This very early work is built upon some of the work in the 3-6 class--you can see the work with the chains is directly related and other work with multiples follows some of the same patterns as the 3-6 work with "multiplication with bead bars." 

Differentiating multiples and factors is sometimes challenging for the adults on the course. A way to think of them is that they are reciprocals of one another. 

**Multiples** are numbers made by multiplying a number (by a whole number). Resulting numbers are all multiples of that base number.

For example, the multiples of 5 are all of the numbers made by multiplying 5 by a whole number--so 10 (5x2), 15 (5x3), 20 (5x4), etc.

**Factors** are the numbers that make another number using multiplication. The factors of 15, for example, are the numbers that can make 15 using multiplication. In this case, only 3 and 5 (as 3x5 is 15). 

Some numbers have many factors. 20, for instance, has more factors than 15. 20 can be made by 2x10 and 4x5, so the factors of 20 are 2, 4, 5, and 10. 

_**Multiples are made by factors, factors make multiples.**_ 

This early work is very concrete--the children are using bead chains, bead bars, and pegs to explore the concepts in a very concrete way and then recording what they observe.

**The other work for this week is new work with common fractions**--we call this level "operations beyond simple cases." This work is still very concrete, as all of the problems will work with the materials, but it does require more reasoning and understanding of equivalence than the "simple operations" level. 

Because it is not easy to find problems that fit the idea of "beyond simple cases" and will work within the confines of the materials, we do have some prepared problems for the children to explore (_**these are for inspiration, they are not assigned!)**_. 

I've added a file of these problems to the lesson so that you can print it for your classroom (or copy some of the problems). 

Usually I've done all of these "live" in class so I'm still editing the videos. I aim to get them all up and ready by Monday, the 23rd.
