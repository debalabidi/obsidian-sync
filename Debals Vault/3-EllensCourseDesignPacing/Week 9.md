**Welcome back to the course!** I hope you had a restful week "off" and that you are all settling in at home. 

**This week will be our first "real" asynchronous week where you will access content on your own.**

**My biggest suggestion is to actually schedule your "course time" into your weekly schedule.** As I explained when we were together, and is also explained in our "start here" lesson for this course (the first one you accessed), I'll start by sending out a "Friday letter." This will introduce you to the main themes of the week and send you to the lesson for the week (likely how you got here). 

**The most efficient work flow is to look to the lesson to see what to work on.** Some people on past courses looked only at what assignments are coming up the following Monday--that is a great way to make yourself frantic. It is best to look to the orientation course lessons for that week to "unfold" the work of the week. It is what we would do if we were together--new content being offered and then a list of due dates. 

**The work offered new for that week will not be due until a week from that Monday**, in this case, not until July 8th. 

I try to do my best to list upcoming due dates, but sometimes I leave one out accidentally--it will still be due as (if you have your settings set up this way) Populi will tell you what is due within a seven day period so there will be no surprises. 

**This week's work will be in Language, Mathematics, and a bit of History.**

Please note that the videos for the Language and Mathematics were shot during the pandemic and so I did not have the actual materials we use for this activity--I made substitutes (which worked fine in this case). I will photograph the actual materials used so that you can see exactly what the real materials look like--I'll post the photos in the lesson for that topic. Also, these were uploaded to Vimeo before they were closed-captioning all of their videos so it doesn't have closed captions.

The handouts are quite detailed so you should be able to get the main ideas of the dialog from the handouts. If you have any challenges, let me know and we can brainstorm some solutions. 

For the History presentation, the video is new and so has closed captions and uses the correct materials. 

**The new work for this week is:**
