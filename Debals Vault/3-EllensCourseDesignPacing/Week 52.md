This week we will cover a topic that people have been asking for a lot. So, this week we will do it! **Planning and record keeping (and the general flow of our work).** 

**By Wednesday,** even though the reading isn't due officially until the 9th, **please try to read over the two documents about planning and record keeping.** We will discuss them in class and go over some of the important aspects of the flow of our work with the children in the classroom. 

The "Supporting teachers, supporting children" is a PDF of a Power Point that I used for a recent workshop in Taiwan--it is bilingual (in Traditional Chinese and English). 

I plan on covering the whole of that presentation this Wednesday during our online class. 

I do apologize for not yet having the non-decimal bases multiplication and division videos ready--we set up the brand new environment in Spokane and it was a bit longer to do that than we expected. But, **the environment is so beautiful and I think you will love working in it. I'm including a link to a video of the environment below.** 

See you Wednesday afternoon!
