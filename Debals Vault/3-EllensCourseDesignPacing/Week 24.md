**The work this week includes** a continuation of previous work in Geography, **exploring the work of air.** 

We will also be preparing for our November 2nd workshop, which is **a supervised practice session focusing on the history question charts**. Please do read all of the lesson for the history question charts and watch both videos. All of this is crucial information for understanding what we will do at our online workshop. 

There is a sign up--I had forgotten to post it earlier, but please attend to it in the upcoming week. You will be proposing and/or signing up for a topic to prepare for the Saturday workshop. _**If you think you won't make the deadline of the 28th, please let us know and we can extend the due date a few days.**_ 

**The last item of this week is the topic of Going Out**. There are several parts to this work and not all of them are due right away. **_Most of what is due on the 4th is reading articles and chapters about Going Out and listening/watching the videos_**. Later work will include writing a paper for a parent night about Going Out and making a Going Out binder with resources for the children in your class. These are not due right away and we will discuss the Going Out binder more at our next online class session on November 13th. 

I head home this weekend so there may be some delays in my response time. For anything urgent, please reach out to Yvonne or Chelsea. I look forward to seeing you all on the 2nd!
