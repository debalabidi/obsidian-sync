Now that we have done so much work exploring equivalence of polygons, we will venture into the measuring of area. Just like so much of the other work we do in geometry, we have some general stages of the children's work:

- **1st: Sensorial** (generally, manipulate materials, potentially record what you see [but not always])
- **2nd: Reasoning** (manipulate materials, think about and articulate what your experience was, perhaps record a part of the work)
- **3rd: Abstraction** (manipulate materials, think about and articulate what your experience was, think about how to express it in symbolic terms [aka: create a formula])

Definitely _**do the work in the order suggested below**_ (and after you have done the previous work with equivalence--that is an essential part of the success in this work). Definitely _**watch all of the videos with your handouts nearby**_ to follow along.

You will see that I added an assignment about angles--I realized we had done an angles activity in Spokane but I had never published the assignment. It is an important series of concepts and activities, so I added it here to be due the same week as the area work. 

Enjoy!
