This week the focus is on Mathematics with the **5th Great Story** and also the **first work with decimal fractions**. Even though we are doing the 5th Great Story--A Story of Our Numerals later in the course, in reality it would be told within the first six or so weeks of the school year.

The work with decimal fractions requires at least some experience with regular fractions.  They don't have to have mastered fractions, but at least have experience through operations beyond simple cases. 

As with all of the work in mathematics, the early work in each chapter can be done with few prerequisites and so can start with the younger children. The concept and notation activities, the simple operations, and the first conversion activities are all good activities for younger children. 

Next week we will tackle the later work with multiplication and division with decimal fractions (but feel free to work ahead if you are interested). 

This week we have an online class on Wednesday the 11th of December from 4-7 pm Pacific Time. **Please read the assignment for [Ecology activities](https://montessorinorthwest.populiweb.com/router/courseofferings/10738319/assignments/26161740/show)** as that will be one of the main focuses of our meeting. If you come prepared, as outlined in the assignment, you will get both valuable experience practicing these activities and also supervised practice hours. 

_**For students transferring from Course 11 or 12**_, if you have not previously had your ecology assignments accepted, then please do complete them as per the Course 13 assignment. If you have previously had all ecology assignments accepted, you can still come to class prepared to practice these presentations and receive credit for supervised practice hours. 

_**We look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday**_!

**The new work for this week includes:**
