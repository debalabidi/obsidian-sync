This week we are doing some final work with Mathematics volume I (the introduction) and then exploring word problems. 

Word problems are, of course, an ongoing part of the work we do in the classroom with the children. This chapter, though, also explores some specific types of word problems and some specific stages in how children may approach word problems. 

Note that these levels may be spread out over years (starting with the sensorial approach with the youngest children, then using calculation as the children gain skills, and then even codifying the processes used to create a "rule" or formula when they have even more skills). 

This week at class on Wednesday, the 26th, we will be doing a synthesis and review of mathematics (what we've done so far) and we will be going over the introduction to mathematics. I look forward to seeing you then!

Please note that the final due date for new submissions for geography and resubmissions of previously identified corrections in geography is Monday, February 24th at 8:30 am Pacific Time.
