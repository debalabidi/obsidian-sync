This week we will mostly be working in Music, but we will also visit handwriting.

I've added more to the Listening and Music History and Literature lessons. I hope to make a few more videos for the second tone bars lessons (there is one video so far, more to come) in the next few days. 

Please do read the specific assignments carefully so that you understand what is being asked of you. I do hope you enjoy the podcast that is assigned which gives some historical perspective of the music work.

Please remember that the **final due date for past due Geography work and corrections is February 24th at 8:30 am Pacific Time.** 

It was great to spend so much time with you this past week. I look forward to our next class together (February 26th).
