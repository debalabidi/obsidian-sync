**The work for this week will be in Mathematics**. We will be finishing the work with multiples and factors and then work towards abstraction with fractions. 

**Please do the work with multiples and factors first**--the children will require the skills from the multiples and factors work to fully come to abstraction with fractions. The first activities with "towards abstraction with fractions" won't require mastery of multiples and factors, but the final work with abstraction will require the children to have greater familiarity with multiples and factors. 

**We do have an online class on Wednesday, the 16th**--the topic will be the theory lecture for **Freedom, Responsibility, and Independence.** Please do add some questions to the discussion topic for this lecture (available in [the lesson](https://montessorinorthwest.populiweb.com/router/courseofferings/10738327/lessons/12679775/show)). I may not get to address all of your questions, but I will try! If I don't get to your question directly that day, I will attempt to address it in the near future. 

I hope you are all enjoying the change of seasons. I'll be back in the Pacific NW on the 27th and I'm looking forward to some cool fall weather!

See you all on the 16th at 4 pm (Pacific Time)!
