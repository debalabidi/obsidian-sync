For the week of November 4th, we will be working on Divisibility. These activities are spread out over a long period of time. You will see a patterns emerge in terms of how we approach this idea of divisibility. 

Divisibility focuses on whether or not a number can be neatly divided (with a whole-number answer and no remainder) by another given number. The focus is on the "whether or not," and so the answer we are seeking is a "yes or no" (not in solving the division). 

The first activities, divisibility by 2, 5, and 25, are the most straightfoward and so are the earliest activities. Once the children have also done some more work with multiples and factors they will explore the other divisibilities. 

Divisibility is one of the ways we can engage the children in activities that strengthen number sense. For children who need extra support in number sense, divisibility activities provide these extra explorations which are presented in a very concrete way. For children who have a strong number sense, divisibility activities will be like games or puzzles which expand and strengthen their thinking. 

I hope you enjoy this exploration of divisibility!
