- The word language comes from the Latin word lingua meaning tongue. (that which is produced by the tongue)
- Other species make sound and some are expressive sounds. 
- No other species has language like humans do.
- Language does not exist in nature but a product of man.
- Language created by humanity through a long period of civilization.
- Language separates humans from other creation.
- Language can be used to convey ideas, emotions, thoughts.
- Other forms of communication is clapping, gesture, facial expression etc, but rely on how other individual interpreting.
- it is a structured system of sound patterns consisting of a socially standardized meaning, relying on an ability to link the sounds we make with mutually acceptable meaning.
- Certain sounds we make , we have agreement that they have a particular meaning. 
- We dont know how  or when language came to be but guess.
- Perhaps it starte with gestures and body language and then some sounds accompanied the gestures.
- For culture to develop , language is a prerequisite, and language takes agreement (of sound and meaning) to communicate.
- language fuses men into groups.
- Language lies at the root of the transformation of the environment that we call civilization. 
- Language is an instrument of collective thought. 
- Most scholars and linguist believe that language had to come before the most primitive and basic aspect of material culture such as tools, bowls, houses, before humans could create material tools they had to have the tool of language.
- Only imagine talk
	- First sounds over time to be understood by group leading to a common meaning.
	- Starting with sounds for basic needs, like food, danger, cold, hot, hurt, 
	- Later on simple sounds were combined into words and names were given to objects.
	- Naming of the immediate environment (animals, plants, rivers etc) first functional language, naming.
	- Naming is a tool for orientation. 
	- Over time language became more complex, words were combined into phrases and simple sentences.
	- As language became complex, the order of words became important.
	- Non inflected languages like English the order of words matter. 
	- To understand and sentence to mean something, they have to be ordered in the agreed upon way.
- For language to be most useful precision is important. If not precise then thoughts cannot be transmitted accurately to others.
- Important to bring the idea of precision to children.
- Language unite thought to thought.
- As thought increased in complexity and collective knowledge began growing, the complexity of language also had to increase.
- Spoken language gave birth to oral tradition as easily man told stories (sang songs and recited poems)
- Based on human tendencies we can surmise that they felt the need to describe and explain with language all that was found about them. 
- Humans began to categorize and list and classify that which they observed. Then added descriptors to the names.
- Language must have gone through the development of describing what was in nature and learning.
- Invented words to explain the things around them. (Season of hunting, phases of moon for planting, all the botanical, zoological and geographical knowledge that they were acquiring)
- People had to develop a nomenclature for the science they were building.
- Through language communicate ideas, desires, needs etc.
- More recently geologically speaking, need to pass on accumulated knowledge.
- Early humans drew pictures to represent ideas. This gave permanence to their knowledge
- Preservation of knowledge allows for capitalizing of collective knowledge of the preceding generations.
- Picture writing was a burdensome and misleading form of communication.
- over time picture writing became symbolic
- Leading to create symbols to represent sound. ( a counterpart to speech, the symbolic representation the sound of speech,)
- written language preserves thoughts for generations to come.

### Language and the young child
- earliest and longest lasting sensitive period is language.
- Begins at or before birth and lasts until after the age of six.
- Infancy:  baby stares at the lips with fascination and responds to human voice.
- Young child will learn language because of its presence in the environment regardless of the language difficulty or culture. (Advantage of being a part of absorbent mind )
-  If not exposed to human voice he will have no interest in spoken language.
- If the child is in the presence of eloquent speakers will inherit the eloquence.
- Through confusion of various sounds, distinguishes key sounds and begins to develop words. That is the sensitive period of work.
- First 2 years learns the language of the environment, not born with power to speak but with potentiality of acquiring complicated language with all its grammar, phraseology, syntax etc.
- Speech seems like a natural part of our human inheritance.
- Speech acquired in first 2 years of life is our mother tongue. (Compare it to learning a language as an adult and the magnitude of effortless language acquisition by child.)
- Child has a particular sensitivity to human voice, is drawn to imitate and practice it.
- Language is the primary accomplishment of the early years. 
- The cerebral cortex is what is mainly involved and there is an auditory center that receives language in the brain.
- The brain must coordinate the movements of the mouth, the nose, the throat, the vocal cords, the diaphragm and the breathing in order to coordinate speech.
- Reception of language must necessarily precede the expression of language
- By age of six month child will utter the first syllable,discriminating  approximately 40 basic sounds in our langauge.
	- First babbles, not related to the language he will eventually speak.
	- Can become a child of any culture at this age, for his potential is vast.
	- practices and refines sounds he will make coordinates movement to reflect the sound of mother tongue.
	- This refinement shapes the potential in one direction, the language of the mother tongue.
- at 10 months
	- When we talk to him fondly the baby realizes these words are meant for him. 
	- Begins to grasp that we are saying them intentionally
- the child might not be able to express himself but understand the meaning of some words and respond to words.
- First intentional words comes around the age of one year.
	- Might have strung together syllables but has yet to speak true words.
	- Words become words, sounds become words, when meaning is attached.
	- The child has ideas during this time which he is unable to express. He is watching defining and categorizing he has preferences and as caregiver takes him around hopefully things are named for him. 
	- The child connects the word with the object indicated and with repeated exposure the baby forms a hypothesis about what quality is being shared.
	- The development of language is directly related to the development of thought and the development of concepts.
	- Language is a catalyst to thought.
- Around 13 months
	- Begins to understand what you are saying around and about him.
- Around 16 months
	- Figured out everything has a name and he enjoyes naming.
	- Child is trying hard to communicate but cannot yet clearly express his own needs regardless of effort.
	- This stage is typically around 16 to 18 or 24 months, it can be frustrating for this child, trying to communicate
	- This is also time for temper tantrums, perhaps the two are correlated, the child's understanding but not able to express and that's really frustrating.
- Sometime around age of 2 the child will have an explosion of language. The culmination of many months of internal psychic development 
- One guideline in developmental determination if the child is ready for CASA whether he can express his needs.

### Language in CASA De Bambini

- Children arrive with language formed
- Environment is fashioned in such a way, in which language continues to develop
- It does so in a way mimicking the process that started at birth.
- Language use more fully, but now with conscious mind to help we can reiterate the process he has undergone unconsciously in the first subplane
- Capitalize on the powerful hunger for words and language (sensitive period)
- sensitive periods are transitory and cant be repeated.
- Build on what the child knows about language.
- Already discovered and explored and classified the sounds of his language unconciously 
- The child is talking and has begun to explore grammar and syntax of language.
- Using language to express himself  and thoughts.
	- To assist in this, we as adults needs to think in terms of helping child in 4 discoveries about language in a conciously aware way
		- child is offered keys to the world of language and materials are at first blush somewhat limited. Compared to the rich materials of the classroom. But abundance of opportunity, 
		- First discovery more words than he already knows. (Vocabulary enrichment with enticing words) Learns nomenclature of biology, geography, geology, names of sensorial qualities, hears stories, poems and rhymes and has conversations. The material is much of it is the directress. Must create a language rich environment. Offer conversation, singing , and story telling, give new words and introduce abstract symbols associated with teh sounds of the language. With sand paper letters child makes discovery of the Phoenicians all over again.
		- He discovers he has language made of sounds (sounds he can make with his voice and see with his eyes. He can make language visible.) With movable alphabets can construct words, his words, words he can say, not constructing words teacher gives him,they are his words,works with single and then phrases, sentences and paragraphs.
		- He learns that he can let others know what he is thinking without speaking a word, 
		- As the child is writing we encourage to write down interesting ideas and stories he has which previously he might have shared orally, something exciting he wants to tell us.
	- written language will continue to develop (with illustration and decorated) an aspect of beauty in all the work the child does.
	-  Third discovery, interpret the thought of others without hearing them speak (reading)
	- Reading and writing are not the whole of language, 
	- Fourth, words have jobs, they each have a function,  be able to interpret tone, voice, and a thoughtful reader, (referred to as total reading, not just decoding and able to sound out words but to be able to interpret it. Beyond simple reading into comprehension.) Function of words and reading analysis are how we lead the child to total reading. In both areas, fun games are presented (exploring meaning and function of words), attention is focused on syntax, how things work together or the order of things
	- Sentiment conveyed by each word. We want to imprint that different kind of words play different roles or have different jobs. Total reader goes beyond the mechanics of reading. allowing the child to interpret the emotion and sentiment of what he reads. This offers the whole of language to the child. 

### Language in the Elementary

- Different characteristics - adults have to adjust to who we are appealing to those children.
- Language presented as imaginative exploration of our world (past, present and future)
- If just as rules of grammar, and list of spelling,  then children will not be interested in studying language.  Mystery and wonder is what we want to transmit
- Powerful tool language, and help them use that tool.
- Six general areas of study in the elementary classroom (not presented separately, veins that run parallel throughout our classrooms, )
	- History of language - exploration of language but be in reference to society and history, connect the child to language, first chapter of study is the history of language.
		- Two forms of language: written and spoken.
		- Help child understand both in his life and human beings life.
		- Written language consists of tools and implementation such as hand printing, telegraph, letterpress, typewriting, word processing all of those things,
		- Spoken language consists of debates and discussions, speech's and presentations, conversations, poetry recitation, dramatic interpretation, 
		- We foster development of spoken language and oral communication in the classroom
		- One approach to the history of language - through study of the lineage in teh story of our language.
		- look at the transformation language has gone through. The etymology of words in our language. Our aim through the introduction of this aspect of language is not to have linguistic scholars but to intrigue the children with the many facets of language.
		- Develop awareness regarding the standards of language and how those standards shift depending on situation or geography.
		- We start the history of language with the story of communications and signs which provides a jumping off point for each child and the child will determine what direction they want to explore.
		- Our approach relys on story telling, various interesting stories to the children to engage them.
	- Another chapter we have is grammar and syntax.
		- Study of words and parts of speech, parts of sentence.
		- In order to think , write and speak properly in a logical way, correct grammar and syntax are essential.
		- Rules of grammar have been agreed upon, and must be followed to have precise thoughts that are interpreted correctly.
		- Spelling enters here. But dont approach it just about the rules. Instead we explore the developments that have taken place throughout history, 
		- Second plane child wants to know why, and to present him with historical reasons for changes in spelling, it stirs his interest in a meaningful way.
		- We should help the child spell the words he use in his writing. This will connect spelling with his intellectual expression and uses a different part of the brain, that if you just have teh child memorize lists and try to give that back to you. 
	- Another chapter is written composition
		- Writing should permeate our classroom. (Imaginative, fictional, factual, research, fantasy, reporting, persuasive, composing music, poetry, all of these genres should be happening at all times in our classroom.)
		- Should be putting thoughts down on paper.
		- The child does need to learn capitalization and punctuation so as with spelling we show this in relation to his own writing, 
		- To give learning meaning and context, we offer him opportunity to base what he's learning on what he needs to know by doing that
		- Mechanics of writing are essential for, the transmission of thoughts (writer)
		- Written composition is not only about mechanics and content, but remember writing can be beautiful like a work of art. We want to bring this awareness as well.
		- We can express thoughts, but allow for artistic self expression 
		- Present writing in forms of books, booklets, scrolls, timelines, plays, speeches, 
- Spoken language with children
	- Should not be quiet
	- Invite to hold conversations.
	- In order to encourage independent thinking, and expression, they must be able to debate, discuss, and have reasoned arguments.
	- It's through spoken language that we help children express themselves and their thoughts.
	- Society of our classroom builds and grows, and develops, based on language,
	- Spoken language necessary for collaboration and cooperation.
	- It hightlights the need to be able to think quickly. (Words out , they are out)
	- Written language can be edited before author publishes it.
	- This is being an individual and having responsibility for our language.
	- Clarity of vision presupposes clarity of thought.
	- Thoughts to be expressed need clear language, and bring this awareness and give tools to accurately express thoughts.
	- We model this for them. Say what you mean and mean what you say. (Would you like to come to this lesson)
	- Literature, we present independent reading by children or out loud reading by the teacher. Both activities should always happen.
	- Ensure access to good books. Prepared environment, offer few carefully chosen jewels of books, but beyond that encourage them to go to the library and seek out books for their enjoyment or use. 
	- Must be allowed to read for pleasure. Do not have to finish every book they start. Should not have to write report on every book, 
	- first plane books are factual and reality based, in second plane child is secure in himself and his orientation in the world, so we can add in books that are fantasy based, fairy tales, myths, legends, fables, (all call imagination of child) and allow for connection to the history of human beings. 
- One material is the interpretive reading card:
	- Not just command cards, idea of interpreting brings child into the mind of the author, introducing the intent (author)
- we read as well. We must choose well written books and variety of different types of literature to read to the children.
- Important to expose them to different authors and genres.
- Expose to different syntax, structure, and word choice,  than what the children usually use.
- Present language not easily accessible for them to digest themselves, style, 
- The sixth chapter is style
	- Geography , history and culture are all, influences on language and self expression.
	- draw attention to difference between persuasive, or descriptive or declarative expressions
	- Area is closely connection to history and human geography
	- Consider historical context and conventions of time to truly understand what the author is trying to say.
	- On avenue is from the perspective of mechanics. (Understanding of grammar and symbols)
	- Grammar symbols highlight patterns in a sentence or paragraph.
	- Analyze writing then can compare, contrast and come to a conclusion regarding a piece of writing. 
- Language and moral development
	- Possess a great sense of justice, admiration, and compassion, 
	- Beginning to develop conscience, 
	- To decide what is right and wrong for himself.
	- Beyond the academic part of language, there is a part of spiritual growth and development of child.
	- This is key to navigate in society
	- Must understand reason for things, but also take responsibility for actions and words.
	- Words are powerful tool/ weapons.(make realize)
	- Understand the impact of words (speaking / writing)
	- Importance of representing who he is to the rest of society.
	- Communication necessary transfer ideas.
	- To be truly oriented around him elementary child must come to understand the impressions and assumption made based upon correct use of language.

### Language in the Adolescent
- Art , music , language personal expression
- Assist the development of personality
- Fluctuate in response to the needs of the individual
- Language, cultivate the art of speaking logically
- Working on dictation, elocution, articulation,
- Expressing thoughts to group and engaging attention of audience.
- Convey thoughts to different audiences. (Formal, informal, professional, academic)
- What and how he will say (developing)
- Drama and poetry  to express own ideas.
- Drama is appealing to adolescent , trying out different roles in his own life to figure out where he will ultimate fit in society.
- Need for reflection and self expression
- They can do with their writing, less risky to practice different roles they perform writing of others.

### Conclusion

All children develop language around same time. Hall mark of human being. Function of society, agreement of sounds and meaning, law and order in languages. These rule create order. There is also mystery, wonder, magic. Enthral and inspire, drag people down, it's intangible, tool of culture, language is talked often about reading and writing at grade level. This looses the real significance of the language as a species to the individual child.
Ignite the imagination and engage rational mind allowing him to access the mystery and wonder in everyday life.
