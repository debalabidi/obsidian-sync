- Come after story of the human being.
- Set the context by talking about previous stories briefly.
- When humans came the environment was prepared for them.
	- To show something about human beings.
	- All about us and the time we have been on earth.
	- if we took teh red strips and stretched it ... this is it.
	- Special gifts and figuring out things, working to meet the fundamental needs of all human beings.
	- Must have been thinking and using their imagination on how to do that.
	- Time went on .... continued meeting their needs, thinking, loving and using their hands.
	- Finding food to eat, making shelter and here we have something special. Look at this.
	- The human hand, a gift given to us. The hand holding a stone, as a tool (dig or build),  you as of today use it to write with pencils , or make dough etc. Just like us, they used hands, 
	- They found water, food, we are here today.
	- We liked beauty, in old pottery.
	- Timeline shows how long humans are on earth
	- Learned to protect themselves
	- But nothing is written down, and we know that they had fundamental needs and they were meeting those needs since we are here.
	- Now watch something very special happens a thin strip of red line.
	- This thin strip is the amount of time the human being have been recording what they have been doing. 
	- Scientist have found early tools ...
	- Show comparison of time before writing vs the thin red strip representing human writing.
	- On another day we will have story about what happened in this time that is represented by the red about writing but not today. 
	- Today we want to think about how much the human beings are on earth not writing things down. 
	- What have they been doing and what has happened. Thank you!
