## Introduction

This story is the framework into which everything else fits in.  This is the cosmic vision of the whole by presenting the story of God with No Hands as a starting point. The main idea of the story is to give tit bits of factual information using allegory and appealing to the imagination and the use of language that is not your ordinary language but is a bit extraordinary making it appealing to the interest and wonder and imagination of children. Example: raging firey of cloud nothingness. The story needs to be dramatic via the use of language. You want to make sure that you are telling the story rather than reading it. 

* Ask questions about God.
* Everything Obey's God's will.
* Talk about Science and solid , liquids and gas and laws associated.
* Keep it impressionistic that is relatable. (Example: Wrinkles are mountains, hallow as oceans)


## Experiments with Story:

#### List of charts:
1A - Firey mass of the sun
3A - The dance of the elements
4A - The earth as an angry volcano
5A - After the rains came and the earth settled down


## Notes:

If you forget some part of the story that you want to convey its ok, you can come back and tell it later, using the following technique, remember when we talked about the creation of earth, I would like to tell you something else and tell them a paragraph and they will want to hear those details again. This is going to tie into geography which will be interlinked with the story of God with no hands.  

Dr Montessori encourages to create admiration and wonder in the children. This will spark the interest of children in chemistry, astronomy, astrology, physical geography.

Don't hesitate to give this story, dont worry about forgetting details, what is more important is that the children feel the wonder and excitement and emotions.

Outward facing with their energy = second plane child. 

Some importants that we want to include in the story and make sure that they are at least addressed in the story with clarity.
* The idea of emensity of the universe. How big do we really mean. The child is using their imagination in a much more creative way. So to address the immensity of the universe as an example saying its big is not sufficient to spark the imagination. The hugeness needs to be emphasized and how to make this assessable to children. One can use analogies. 
* Each little particle were given laws to obey. Likes and dislikes, reaction to temperature etc. leading to the formation of earth.
* Underlying order that  governs everything.

Started with a child asking Dr Montessori Who is God? What is God? And where is God?
This story came into existence because a child inquired about God. Dr Montessori designed this story to address the reasoning mind  of children.
to understand the beginnings of everything and connect and develop relationships with knowledge and organize it...?

**Replacement word for God:** Force of nature, the great being, underlying law and order, force of nature, power of nature.

The invitation to the story should be something special. The children should feel invited. The word feeling is important. The invitation could potentially be the day before. 

The setup could be special as well. More so like a stadium in front of the science table. Make it extra special for the child who are younger by mentioning to them that I have an extra special seat for you guys.  

Potential invitation the day before: Alright my friends, I want to let you know that we will be have a special day that I have planned for everyone. So when you come in tomorrow things might look a little different. 

### Prepared Environment:
This story is typically given right at the beginning of the year after the first week of the class. 

Setup the two experiments before hand, have the charts ready and you as a guide will clean it up. 

After the story is over: give the children time to reflect either individually or as community by talking to each other. You walk away by cleaning up and letting them process it on their own. 

There are many version that may have more experiments and this is something that can be experimented around and should be something that a guide should decide maybe based on the composition of the class and what the children are interested in. 

A need to have carefully chosen beautiful books in the environment to supplement that is accessible to the age that you teach.  For 6 - 12 you will have a range of books. Impress upon children the need to take care of the environment and the books in it. 

The decrease in experiments is because it is hard to get it done for teachers in the first week of school. (Question: if the teacher can pull it off would it be beneficial for them? )

Need to annotate the story to ensure where the charts come and the experiment as well. 


**Question**: If the word God is looked down upon in a community then change it. However, a question remains, does this mean our communities dictate that God cannot be talked about? Human history is full of people some believed stars to be Godly for example, can we not talk about those. Are communities not open in general?

## Experiments:

[01:17](https://youtu.be/R8vnNjweoCY#t=77.70917241344405)
The coming together of particles experiment / demonstration.
Need a tray with a clear glass bowl and some paper dots from a whole punch. 

[02:11](https://youtu.be/R8vnNjweoCY#t=131.57008471533214)
Tip: always have towel near by when ever you have water involved.

Drop the paper dots starting from the edge and towards the center and after some waiting some particles will come together giving the impression of elements coming together in an impressionistic style.

Volcano made out of paper mashe, inside there is a flask or bottle, baking soda, clear dish soap, red and yellow food color. Double loaded turkey baster and household vinegar. 

Tip: Do not use any chemicals for safety of children. 
Tip: Make the volcano the same day

Visual impression, engaging for elementary aged child. It gives them the idea of hot matter coming out. 

## Further work with God with No Hands:

The perspective is the coming of the universe and the coming of the earth. Key ideas interesting to children. The overall purpose of the story is to build admiration and wonder leading to generating interest in the whole universe providing the framework to children to learn and organize the information. There is no teaching outcome but to get the children excited and build on it. 

If the children come and ask something about the story, or want to hear it again. See if you can tell a mini story based on what they are interested in. Or you could initiate with children by telling them for example, you know I was thinking of Story of God with no Hands, and the idea that their is something colder than ice. What could be colder than ice, and then do a demonstration for it.  

Something to watch out for: never put glass on a heat source. It is a hazard. Even if the glass is heat proof. 

List of demonstration
1. State of matter. 
	1. (Heat proof mat, heat source and any safety around it, tongs, wax, solder, wax will ignite once it starts to ) state of matter changes based on temperature. 
	2. Liquid settle according to weight demonstration. (3 test tubes, water, oil and honey, put them in one test tube and oil settles at the bottom, water and honey on top, flip the test tube and oil goes to the bottom, and honey shifts to the top.)
	3. Colder than ice demonstration : two identical container, equal amount of crushed ice , salt and thermometer. Start with measuring the temperature of one without ice and then measuring with ice to see that difference. They children could touch the ice and feel and sense it in a safe way. For older children why does this happen? What is going here? This leads to the property of water and how water behaves different.  ( the idea that is something colder than ice representing the idea coldness of space)
	4. Further work to the relative size of the sun:
		1. Difference between the size of sun and the earth. Chart 1A is not in proportion. But maybe the children want to draw something in proportion. Tape pieces of paper together.  Comparison with the wooden hierarchical material. The tiny unit is one millionth of the size of the large green cube. This gives the children a visual impression of the difference of size. That can be very powerful to the children to visualize it. Older children might want to do scientific calculation, how far is the sun, how big is the sun ? Leads to scientific calculations with big numbers.
		2. Further work on the solar system , use chart 2A. Even though the chart is not in proportion sun being very small, the older children might want to build a model that is the correct representation of the solar system in context of size proportion / ratio. Pluto is not colored and provides children a great opportunity to discuss what constituetes being a planet? Etc. 
		3. Planets orbiting the sun: (yarn ball and a string, counter clockwise direction, modifying the length of the string and swinging it around your head as being the sun. Demonstrating the concept of orbiting and the time it takes in a very simple easy way. )
These can be done a week after the story of God with No Hands. Pick up on the interest of the children from the story.
