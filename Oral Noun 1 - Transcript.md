so for this your materials are you're going to have a collection of grammar box cards about 20 of them um they'll come from various filler boxes and you don't need to worry because they're all coded on the back and so you'll be able to put them back and you want the majority of the cards
you're choosing to be either nouns or words that can be used as nouns and you want to make sure you have some examples that are not on black cards but could be nouns okay um do not choose any interjections or any pronouns okay we also need the grammar symbols and we have a little card that says noun it's the same size as our grammar box cards this is work for our earliest children in the elementary our six-year-olds we're gonna start with a few games that we are going to play i'll just talk you through them like we're doing it but you're going to write it up if we were together you would be up and playing these games small groups of you um but we're not together and it wasn't a plan to not be together right so i don't have um access to humans in my environment to record this for you with humans doing it so we'll use our imaginations and follow
directions how about that so you're gonna invite a small group of children probably four or five
for the oral introduction and so have um a subheading that says oral introduction gather your little group frame what is your name the child answers brandon and what is your name christopher and what is your name bethany and how about you what is your name maya yeah you each have a name don't you well i'm gonna go over here and you listen and when i say your name you come to me so go across the room where they can still see you and quietly say someone's name bethany we're not gonna shout across the room you're gonna quietly say their name they're listening they're watching bethany and then bethany comes over well bethany you came but the other children didn't hmm stay right here then i'm gonna move to another space in the environment brandon and brandon comes over well brandon you didn't come when i called bethany and now you're here but they're still over there and you'll continue moving a little bit right until you've called each child's name let's all come back together did you notice that when i called bethany's name only bethany came and the same happened for each of you that you only came when i called your name you each have a name does this have a name and i'm going to point with my group to things in the classroom and right now i'm pointing to a plant it's a plant and what about that right there that's our box of tissues and over there yeah that's a picture on the wall huh well i have an assignment for you walk all around this classroom without disrupting any other children this is very serious work walk all around this classroom and i want you to come back when you found something that doesn't have a name okay let's see who can be the first to come back with something that does not have a name the children and you would too actually if we were together would would come back with various and sundry like maybe they'll come back with air in their hand or a dust bunny or something they don't know the name of each time they return you're going to name the thing that they're holding right so it seems like everything you brought back has a name we might not know the name but it has a name well let me give you another task that's okay let me give you another task walk quietly around this room without disturbing any other children and bring me go bring it bring me oh oh i'm sorry i didn't tell you what to bring oh okay sorry um you bring a cube you bring a shell you bring a book you bring a pencil now can you bring me what i'm asking you to bring ha ha now you can the children return what did you bring you brought a shell how did you know to bring a shell because i asked you to bring a show exactly right now ask each child what they brought and how they knew not just one child and then invite them to return their items and come back names are very very important do you know that the egyptians would give two names to every baby born there was a public name and a private name they thought if if other people knew the real name it would give power over that person so that was a private name that's how powerful the egyptians saw names to be so interesting i have a lot of stories about nouns and names of things for you
