Parenting is as old as humankind. Many people believe that parenting is an instinct and it’s not something that is learned, talked about, or can be improved upon. Everyone has their beliefs in regards to what is good parenting. 

  

Parenting is something extremely complex; it includes practical activities, skills, thoughts, relationships, emotions, and experiences. Parenting is defined by both: the individual characteristics of the parent and the characteristics of the child/ren.  
  
Parenting and the understanding of what a good parent is has evolved tremendously in the past 100 years. In the past, a good parent used to teach their children obedience. Nowadays, a good parent will teach their children freedom, happiness, and creativity.

  

Write down your definition of a parent?  
  
List three characteristics of a good parent?



The famous child psychologist Jean Piaget says: "From a moral and intellectual point of view, a child is born neither good nor bad, he is the master of their own destiny."



If you want your child to talk, it is important to ask the right questions. Start the conversation by asking open-ended questions that would encourage the child to share details.  
  

  

Instead of asking "Do you like this song?", Which guarantees either "yes" or "no", ask "What do you think about this song?", which will allow the child to say more.  
  

  

Instead of just asking who they have played with, ask them what games they played. Let them explain to you in detail without interrupting.  
  

  

Also, never avoid the questions your child asks. If you do not have an answer to your child's question, check it and return to your child later with an answer. Ignoring or deliberately avoiding a question may discourage your child from asking questions in the future.

# Pay attention to the environment. 

  

Research proves that a child's behavior and attitude are shaped largely by the environment in which he or she is raised. To get to know the child better, you need to pay attention to the environment in which he/she lives.  
  

  

Research also shows that the environment can affect a child's brain development, which in turn affects language development and cognitive skills. The home environment affects your child's overall development more than any other environment.  
  

  

Your child's behavior largely depends on the people they interact with on a daily basis and how they interact with the children. Take time to assess the atmosphere both at home and in kindergarten / school. For example, if your child is aggressive, it is desirable to follow what is happening and find out what or who influenced the child to behave in this way.


# The relationship between parenting styles and child behavior

  

In 1967, psychologist Diana Baumrind began a longitudinal study in an attempt to establish the influence of parental upbringing on the mental development of the child. For 14 weeks she conducted interviews with parents of 3-4 year old children, observed the relationship between them at home and between the children in kindergarten. Baumrind identified three groups of children: friendly, conflicted and irritable, and impulsive-aggressive. After analyzing the behavior of the parents of these children, he found that there is a connection between the parenting style and the emotional and cognitive development of the child. The research reveals three characteristics that consistently distinguish one effective style from several less effective ones (Table 1):  
  

1. Acceptance and commitment (expressing warmth and pride in the child's behavior)  
  

2. Control (attempts to direct the feeling of dependence)  
  

3. Giving autonomy (requirements for greater maturity, listening and talking to the child).  
  
There are 4 varieties of parenting style: authoritative parents who have high values on all four indicators; authoritarian parents who show only a high degree of control, permissive parents who show high results only in terms of care and uninvolved parents who have low scores on all indicators.

# Permissive Parents

  
Parents who show high results only in terms of care. The permissive style is warm and welcoming, but non-committal and over-liberal. Indulgent parents are interested in their children, they live with their problems, but without exercising control over them or imposing demands and punishments. Forgiving parents have little or no control over their child's behavior. Parents can't cope with their children and as a consequence, kids  start doing what they want and so they don't learn to control their behavior. These parents allow children to make independent decisions at an age when they are not yet ready to do so. These immature decisions are not in the best interests of the child.

Some pampering parents really believe in this approach and deliberately do not place restrictions based on the idea that when combined with warmth, it will help the child develop their creativity. Many others simply lack confidence in their ability to influence a child's behavior. They are "friends" of their children. Although they are very attached to their little ones, they fail to build authority. If the positive emotions in the family depend on whether the child will receive everything, the parents put a sign of equality between love and satisfaction of demands. The more the demands of the children increase, the more pain they will feel from the lack of attention.

  
**Consequences**

Despite the good expectations of the parents ("We provided everything for him, why did it happen?"), These children are socially incompetent with poor self-control. Children very often want their desires to be satisfied immediately and do not feel much respect for others. They are unpopular with their peers. The children of pampering parents are impulsive, disobedient and rebellious. Compared to those whose parents exercised more control, they are openly pretentious and dependent on adults, showing less perseverance in tasks. Adolescents are not able to properly navigate the relationships between people, are not prepared for the limitations and responsibilities that each person must take to exist, are not able to take into account the interests of others. These children often have inadequate and too high self-esteem.


# Authoritarian parents 

  

Authoritarian parents show only a high degree of control. The authoritarian style of raising a child is characterized by poor acceptance and commitment, strong coercive control, and limited autonomy. Authoritarian parents place many restrictions, using punishment as a style, requiring children to follow instructions, to respect work and effort.

  

An authoritarian parent has certain qualities:

• Rigidity (lack of flexibility) - this attitude supports certain beliefs, even when they cannot be explained;

• Intolerance of uncertainty - this type of parents have difficulty in situations that are not clearly defined.

Authoritarian parents seem cold and repulsive, they keep distance from their children. To exercise control, they shout, command, criticize, and threaten, expecting unconditional obedience. If the child resists, the authoritarian parents resort to force and punishment. They require strict obedience and a certain standard of behavior that is not explained to the child. ("You will do this because I tell you so.") All decisions affecting children are made by the parents. An authoritarian parent refuses to accept his children's ideas when they do not coincide with his and this creates hostility. Adolescents are left with the opportunity only to listen to their parents and fulfill their requirements without discussion. 

These parents want to solve practically everything for the children and often interrupt or belittle their ideas, decisions or choice of friends. When they are dissatisfied, they withdraw their love, making their attachment dependent on the child's obedience. In addition, they have excessively high expectations, which do not correspond to the developing abilities of the child. 

Children under psychological control exhibit adjustment problems, including both anxious, closed, and disobedient, aggressive behaviors. They create the feeling that children are incapable of anything. They only want them to thank them and thus strengthen their inner security. 

  
**Authoritarianism does not presuppose respect**  
  

Parents demand respect, but do not feel obliged to show it. The authoritarian parent tries to achieve security through the use of force. Authoritarianism is based on the fear of harm, of underestimating others, in order to achieve apparent security, to hide failure and weakness. In parents, it can acquire different and very sophisticated forms. But no matter how different these forms are, they are united by one common thing: "the need for domination."  
  

  

In addition to unjustified direct control, authoritarian parents engage in a finer type called psychological control, in which they intrude and manipulate children's verbal expression, individuality, and parental attachment. These parents want to solve practically everything for the child and often interrupt or belittle his ideas, decisions or choice of friends. When they are dissatisfied, they withdraw their love, making their attachment dependent on the child's obedience. In addition, they have excessively high expectations, which do not correspond to the developing abilities of the child. Children under psychological control exhibit adjustment problems, including both anxious, closed, and disobedient, aggressive behaviors.  
  

  

Authoritarianism can be expressed in a softer form - the so-called authoritarian devotion - always choosing what the parents think is best for the child, without respecting the child's opinion. Help is always available, but it is forced. This type of parents suggests that they should do everything for their children. They create the feeling that children are incapable of anything. They only want them to thank them and thus strengthen their inner security. They want "only to be loved," which means not to be contradicted. Usually the reaction against this authoritarianism is emotional rebellion, fear, tension, repressed anger, lies, remorse, guilt.  
  

  
**Consequences.**  
  

The children of authoritarian parents are characterized by social incompetence, they are anxious, unhappy and have low self-esteem; they rely poorly on themselves and tend to react with hostility when frustrated. Forceful methods of discipline make them more aggressive. The boys show a high degree of anger and open disobedience. Girls are more likely to be addicted and overwhelmed by challenging tasks.  
  

  

The children are rebellious and hostile to their parents. They become disobedient and aggressive in their relationships with other people, leaving their parents as soon as they are able to do so. They have difficulties in their relationships with peers, do not enjoy influence among them, because the authoritarian style does not build self-control and self-restraint in relationships with other people, and these qualities are absolutely necessary to occupy a high place in the structure of each group. The children do not show initiative. Authoritarian style leads to obedience, humiliation, exhaustion, to depriving the child of the opportunity to take responsibility for their actions.


# Authoritative Parents

  

Authoritative parents have high values ​​on all three indicators. Authoritative style is the most successful approach to raising a child. It includes strong acceptance and commitment, adaptive control techniques and giving appropriate autonomy. Authoritative (democratic) parents are warm, considerate and sensitive, establishing pleasant, emotionally satisfying relationships with the child, which attract him in a close relationship. At the same time, they establish unwavering, reasonable control when necessary.  
  

In their communication with the child, they explain their actions and encourage the children to express their opinions on their own. They insist on mature behavior and give reasons for their expectations. Parents hold all power in the family firmly, expressing their concern for their children by explaining the need for one way or another.  
  
**Control and prohibitions are a very important part of education**

Education without prohibitions denies the difference between the generations. This lack puts the child at risk. Education based only on prohibitions is tantamount to violence. The child is built thanks to what is given to him, but also to what is denied to him. The secret to good parenting lies in the way children are instilled. It should not look like a good wish, but like a shared transmission of selected values.  
  

  
**Authoritative parents encourage children to be independent**

Authoritative parents are committed to gradually, appropriately providing autonomy, allowing the child to make decisions in areas for which he or she is ready. The general atmosphere in the family is of trust, respect, justice and warmth to others.

  

This type of parents have several attitudes:

• Acceptance - they are tolerant of the opinions and desires of children, do not impose their opinion by force and do not seek to subdue the child by imposing on him their own measure of perfection; they show emotional warmth and responsiveness.

• Understanding - they try to understand the situation from the child's point of view, do not rush to conclusions before listening to the child's explanations and responding to their experiences.

  
**Consequences**

Children who have received love, care and trust from their elders in their family later treat other people in the same way. During childhood and adolescence, authoritative parenting is associated with a number of aspects of competence. These include optimism, self-control, cooperation, high self-esteem, social and moral maturity, and good performance in school. Children are characterized by social competence and responsibility. Adolescents participate in making all decisions in the family, listen and discuss parents' opinions.

Children understand that there are other people, other attitudes and other ways of perceiving reality. In this way the personal responsibility and independence of the children is built and they gradually prepare for independent living. Coming out of adolescence, they have the confidence to meet life's challenges. Authoritative parents make appropriate demands and give autonomy to the child. They encourage children to be independent by promoting high self-esteem and social maturity.


In 1991, Baumrind continued to study children who had reached adolescence. She finds that authoritarian style retains its positive importance in strengthening the child's ties with parents, while authoritarian style has a negative impact, children have low academic and intellectual achievement, this is especially true for girls (especially their social and cognitive competence). The other style, expressed in disinterest, also has a negative effect on children. These children are aggressive, impulsive, anxious, sad, have low self-esteem and alcohol problems.

# Self-esteem

  

Parents meet many of the child's basic needs - trust and security, love and warmth, importance and respect, protection and support. In the dialogue with his/her parents the child masters many of their values ​​and views and turns them into part of his behavior and consciousness. Self-esteem and self-awareness begin with parental evaluation. Unconditional love lays the foundations for building one's own identity. The family creates unique, strong and meaningful connections between people. Attachment to parents, siblings usually lasts a lifetime and serves as a model for relationships in the wider world of neighbors, school and community. The family is the place where children learn the language, the skills, learn the moral values ​​of their culture. Warm and satisfying family relationships guarantee mental health during development and adequate self-esteem. Neglect or alienation from the family almost always leads to serious developmental problems, as often to low or inadequate self-esteem.

  

Self-esteem has several main components: the feeling that we are loved, the sense of self-worth and the sense of competence. If, because of the experience of childhood, a person is not deeply convinced that he/she deserves to be loved as he/she is, self-esteem suffers, and as a result, relationships suffer.

If one's faith in one's own dignity is undermined, one does not dare to defend one's territory, beliefs and desires decisively enough. If he/she is told from an early age that he cannot cope on his/her own, that he is incompetent, it is difficult for him/her to realize their potential.


# Fatherhood and male role modeling

  

There’s a statistical correlation showing that young men who grow up without a male role model present are more likely to end up in prison later in life. Furthermore, these men are more likely to develop negative behaviors and habits related to substance abuse and other addictions.

  

On the other hand, many father figures will become tyrannical in the way that they will be imposing extremely high standards of behavior on their sons. Those fathers will always be judging and criticizing. A kid raised by an absent father and a kid raised by a tyrannical father will both have low self-esteem, low sense of security, problems forming intimate relationships. 

  

When it comes to intact families, statistical data suggests that on average a father will spend 10 minutes a day with his kids on a face-to-face basis.


# The Past should not influence the Present

  

It’s important to understand that you need to be a positive role model - now. Admittedly, everyone has indulged in behavior that is inappropriate. You need to be confident that whatever happened in the past doesn’t have to dictate your present. Many clients have stated that they feel it’s hard to be a positive role model because of past experiences. It may be hard but it’s important to give your best. You need to know that you can change. Whoever you were before your children were born is not present anymore. Moreover, almost all parents state that they have changed dramatically after they had children. Thus, no one is that same person!

  

Be confident that you can be the most positive role model to your children! If you consider that you need help with moving forward from your past you may need additional professional help!


# Set rules and follow them

  

For instance, many families adopt the “quiet voice inside the house” rule. Adults need to be consistent with following the rules and boundaries. If children recognize that your behavior does not match what they are being told to they might:

-   feel lied to or betrayed
-   become resentful
-   not follow the rule at

  

List rules that are adopted in your family? Rate from 1 to 10 your consistency of following the rules you set.


# What you do

  

What you do is a primary way of modeling behavior. How you behave under stress or in a difficult situation influences your child and their behavior under similar situations. Eating healthy and exercising can establish healthy habits in children from an early age.

  

It’s equally important what you do and what you avoid doing in the company of your children.




# What you say

  

What you say is a secondary way of modeling your child’s behavior but it may be as important as what you do. Using positive phrases and forms of speech can influence your children in a positive way. Demonstrating negative emotions through words and being judgemental, critical and pessimistic will have a detrimental influence.

  

For example, a client once complained that his son refused to do his math homework. When asked why this happens the client responded: “The truth is I’ve complained many times about my bad math experiences. Now, my son uses the exact same excuses I’ve shared with him. Worst part is he doesn’t even want to try to do his homework. I wish I had never complained about my math experiences in his presence.”

  

This exemplifies both a pessimistic and judgemental behavior from the parent that influenced the child in a harmful way.

# What is empathy?

  

Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to perceive and evaluate emotions. Psychologist Daniel Goleman suggests that there are 5 fundamental components of EI: empathy, self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation and social skills.

  

Arguably, empathy is a key to high emotional intelligence and it is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Thus, empathy is an essential skill for a good parent. On it own, empathy is related to:

-   Feeling other people’s emotions
-   Reasoning about another individual perspective (walking in their shoes)
-   Helping them

  

To put it another way, empathy is the ability to associate someone's emotions with their needs.

  

Why do we need to identify emotions and needs? Why is this important?

  

Our emotions are the feedback of how well we live our life and how well we meet our needs. When we are experiencing positive emotions, that's our feedback loop telling us that our needs are satisfied. Oppositely, when we face negative emotions that means that our needs are not met.

  

The same rule applies to the people surrounding us. Their negative emotions are a clear message that something is either bad or good. First, we have to identify our own needs, make an effort to meet them. Then, we have to identify the needs of our family, and do our best to help those people meet their needs. The need for harmony, stability, and happiness are a bit abstract but they are formed at a very young age.

  
List 3 of your needs and what emotions do you feel when your needs are not met?  
  
(example: some people say that they become grumpy when they are hungry)


# How does empathy help us be good parents?

  

Empathy helps us analyze emotions, find needs, adopt our behavior to better suit those needs. When it comes to our children, we can identify the child's needs, find ways to meet them, instead of blaming the kid for acting up.  
  
Empathy helps us build our tolerance level as parents. As a result empathetic parents are less likely to express anger, frustration, and aggression.

  

Children of empathetic parent are expected to have higher levels of:

-   Emotional stability
-   Self-esteem
-   Motivation
-   Communication Skills
-   Popularity among peers

  

On the other hand, children who grew up in environment lacking empathy:

-   More likely to suffer of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem
-   More likely to develop behavioral problems in regards to anger, aggression, and violence
-   More likely to to be involved in crime
-   More likely to face problems developing emotional intimacy
-   More likely to have problems with drug and alcohol abuse

  

Empathy helps us connect with others. Kids learn to connect with others at a very young age. Attachment theory states that being able to connect with others from a young age is a good indicator for healthy development. In fact, being able to bond with others boosts the sense of security and stability in infants. Later in life, during adolescence that will result in higher self-esteem, better emotional stability, greater sense of security.

  

In fact, the connection between empathy and attachment can be observed as early as the first days of a newborn. When the baby begins to cry and the caretaker lifts them, holds them, and feeds them the baby will experience bonding for the first time. This display of empathy and connection is important for the babies as they are heard and their needs are met.


# Why is empathy so hard?

  

When we are experiencing anger, anxiety, and stress our body and mind operates from the primitive survival mode. Experiencing such hardships is counterproductive to being empathetic. Our survival mode is extremely effective when it comes to physical dangers. Unfortunately, our brain does not recognize the difference between physical danger and other non-physical threats such as verbal attack. This verbal attack may be your spouse criticizing you for something and your brain interpreting the situation as a threat.

  

When you perceive something as an immediate threat your body releases adrenaline and cortisol, hormones which prepare your body for “fight”, “flight” or “freeze”. Your heart beats faster and stronger, your respiratory rate goes higher, your muscles get tense. When your body is regularly exposed to stressors that have long term effects on your health.

  

Here are 5 signs that will help you determine when you operate out of your survival mode on a regular basis:

-   Everything is urgent. You feel pressed by deadlines.
-   The stress and anxiety levels are high. You have trouble sleeping well at night.
-   It’s hard to find joy. Even in things that you used to enjoy.
-   You are easily annoyed or even irritated.
-   You feel sad or have a depressed mood.


# Promote empathy in yourself

  

You are an adult, hence, you are not only responsible for yourself but for your child as well. Before you teach your children empathy you need to improve upon your empathy skills.

  

Research indicates that in the past 50 years the levels of empathy have significantly dropped. Many factors contribute to this but some of them are: 

-   rise of ambient stress
-   rise of social media influence
-   rise of individualism
-   smaller family sizes
-   stronger urge for career development

  

The questions being asked are: Can empathy be learned? Can empathy be improved upon?

  

The answers are: yes and yes. Empathy is a skill and can be learned, improved upon and exercised. Yes, not everyone is born to be a natural empath. However, most people learn empathy throughout the entirety of their life. No matter how old you are you can learn to be empathetic. Below are a few ways to practice empathy in your life on daily basis:

  

  
**Discover new viewpoints**

This exercise aims at putting you in the shoes of someone else. Begin by learning about other people and how they live. To start with, you can read articles and books about other people. You may volunteer at a local club or a social organization. Do your best to leave your comfort zone and your current social circle.

  

  
**Connect with new people**

Once you have expanded your social circle, do your best to connect with new people. Connection is a two-way street. You need to practice on being a good listener. To be a good listener you need to:

-   Give the speaker your undivided attention.
-   Demonstrate that you are listening: nod occasionally, smile, and watch your body language.
-   Provided non-judgemental feedback.

  

  
**Be aware of your biases and stereotypes**

We all have unconscious biases revolving around race, gender, age, social status and so on. Stereotyping impedes our ability to empathize with others. It prevents us from observing the world from someone else's viewpoint.


# Promote empathy in yourself towards your children

  

In this section we will discuss some practical examples of how to promote your empathy when communicating with your children.

  

**Be considerate about what matters to your child**

-   Do not ridicule something that is important for your child.
-   Do not minimize the importance of the things that your child is interested in.
-   Do not belittle or ridicule their fears.

  

  
**Be able to apologize and say sorry**

Many parents have trouble saying sorry and this is especially true for authoritarian parents. Saying sorry will not make you look weak parent or an incompetent parent. Parents who say sorry when they crossed the line raise children with higher confidence and self-esteem. Undoubtedly, it will also teach the children that they have to say sorry.


# Promote and Nurture empathy in your child

  

As you already know, the first step would be to empathize with your child and be a role model for empathy around your child. However, there are further steps that can be taken in that direction.

  

**Read your child stories about feelings.** Yes, child stories are much about life lessons and morals, however, it’s proven that children can empathize with the characters in the stories. Reading to your children stories is a great way to improve their vocabulary, attention span, creativity, social and emotional development as well as their level of empathy.

  

**Discuss with your child other’s emotions.** Kids like to ask questions. Often they will ask “Why is Abbie sad?” and then it’s your job to do your best to rationalize why that is. 

  
**Help your child express their empathy.** Navigate them by saying something like: “Why don’t you go give this candy to Abbie and give her your toy to play with”.


# How to become a better listener

There are hearers and listeners. To be a good listener you need to go beyond just hearing sounds. You need to be present in the conversation, to reflect upon the transmitted information and to return a response.

  

Like any other skill, the skill of listening can be learned and improved upon through dedication and practice.

  

**Give the other person your full attention**

Giving the other person your full attention is a sign that you care and respect them. That way, they will be more open, caring and respectful. To give your full undivided attention make sure to eliminate any distractions so you can focus on the person you talk to. This may include taking away your phone, shutting off the television, or just stop doing what you do. Of course, sometimes you cannot give your full attention, then just explain that and ask if later time will work for them. Giving your kid or partner full attention will boost their confidence, esteem, and it will make them feel valued.

  

  
**Ask follow-up questions**

Many people perceive conversation as a tennis match. One person says some and the other is eager to reply back. There is no actual two-way communication. To be a good listener you need to understand the other person. To better understand the other side just ask them questions. 

  

  
**Be patient**

Conversations sometimes become tedious and prolonged. You need to be patient, do your best not to force conversations to an end. Let the other person talk, do not interrupt them unless they want your feedback. Furthermore, encourage the other person to talk.

  

  
**Show that you are listening**

Demonstrate that you are actively listening. The best way to do that is your body language. The first step is good eye contact even if the other person is looking away. Some people are anxious that their eye contact may be perceived as staring. Remember, it is okay to look away, just make sure to look away slowly. Next, you can have the occasional nod and smile when appropriate.


# How to be assertive when communicating

  
Once again, assertiveness is about standing your ground without putting someone else down. That is only possible if you establish good boundaries.

  
**Use non blaming statement**

Blame statement is any statement which assigns responsibility for suffering to someone. A non-blaming statement will not assign the responsibility of an unfortunate situation to someone but instead it will just report it. A no blaming statement usually starts with “I”. Some examples are:

-   I feel
-   I want
-   I need
-   I think

  

However, make sure not to hide a blaming sentence inside an “I” statement sentence. For example:

-   I feel sad about the way our conversation went down (non-blaming).
-   I feel that you were purposefully acting like a jerk today (blaming).

  

  
**Next level “I” statement**

Once you master non-blaming statements you will have to upgrade our communication techniques. More often than not you will have to point out certain mistakes or try to correct problematic behavior. When this is necessary we use the next-level “I” statement, which follow this formula:

  

**I feel** (describe your feeling)

**When you** (describe the problematic behavior)

**Because** (describe how the behavior affects you)

**I need** (describe the desired behavior)

  

A good example here is: I feel afraid when you don’t answer your phone because I worry about you. I need you to be more considerate of my feelings.

  
**Use appropriate body language**

Non-verbal communication is as effective and as important as verbal. You have to be in a position that you are not perceived as threatening or intimidating otherwise all your efforts will go to waste. Good example when speaking with your children is to sit down on the floor and have your eyes on the same level as your child’s eyes. Keep yourself open and approachable, this way you will not be perceived as threatening.

  

  
**Use appropriate tone of voice**

The tone of voice should be appropriate based on the environment, the person, and the underlying emotions. If you are conveying a message to the other person about something that made you angry then your tone should be firm. If your voice is too soft then you will be using passive communication style instead of assertive. On the other hand, yelling and raging are unacceptable no matter the situation, plus they are a pattern of the aggressive communication style.

  

  
**Monitor and control your emotions**

If your emotions are taking over, maybe you feel angry, frustrated, disappointed just postpone the conversation. Yes, these feelings are normal, however, if they are too intense it’s possible that you either become too aggressive or too passive. Undoubtedly, this will impede your chances of being assertive and standing your ground. Breath slowly, close your eyes and count to 10 if necessary.


# Assertive communication

  

Assertive communication is typically the healthiest form of communication and it is the ability to communicate your thoughts, feelings and opinions in such a way that your views and needs are clear and easy to understand by others. Importantly, when communicating your needs and thoughts to others you have to be aware not to put down or ridicule their own thoughts, feelings and opinions.

  

Being a good communicator will help you with your children, partner, and other family members. Assertive communication is a soft skill that is in demand in the workforce. By improving upon your own communication skills you will do better as an employee, spouse/partner, and parent. Your levels of stress and anxiety will drop thus leaving you with more free time, in a better mood and healthier. 

  

Why is being a good communicator at home a valuable skill?

Communication at its core is the ability to express your needs. Being able to communicate your needs in a way that they will be understood and met is valuable. Moreover, being able to understand the needs of others is as important. Many clients will say that they never knew what their partners wanted. Unfortunately, many of them will say the same thing about their children as well. Good communication at home will help you avoid emotional hurt, misunderstanding, conflicts and incidents. Although it's a cliche, we need to point out that communication is a two-way process. You need to be an assertive communicator so that you expect your children to be as well. It will be extremely hard for you if your children are passive or aggressive communicators. This is why it's important for you to teach them by example and role model how to do it. 

  

Research suggests that assertive communication is by far the most effective communication style that will result in getting what you wanted. Next, people who start practicing assertive communication state that they:

-   Are better connected to others
-   Feel that their environment is more respectful and stable
-   Are understood and respected
-   Are not anxious to talk to people
-   Bring up problems as they arise, not when it’s late.
-   Are able to find win-win solutions
-   Find themselves more approachable by others

# Aggressive communication

  

This form of communication is the complete opposite of passive communication. Aggressive communicators tend to express their thoughts and feelings in such a way that they completely disregard and violate the rights and thoughts of others. This form of communication is completely unacceptable in any environment especially in such that there’s children present.

  

Some of the aggressive communication patterns are:

-   Dominating and intimidating others
-   Humiliating or ridiculing others
-   Criticizing or attacking others
-   Blaming and finger-pointing 
-   Using threatening tone or words
-   Using hate speech
-   Labels people

  

Give three examples of times when you wrongfully criticized your children?


# Passive communication

  

This style of communication is most often associated with the avoidance of expressing your thoughts and opinions. This style of communication is often associated with a lack of clarity, honesty and understandment. Passive communicators tend to build up on grievances, annoyances, and resentment. As they reach their tolerance threshold we may expect unproportionate anger outburst and other unacceptable behavior. Moreover, soon after the incident they will feel guilt and shame as their own image of themselves has been ruined and they do not recognize themselves in that image.

  

Some destructive communication patterns of the passive communication are:

-   Avoidance, also called “stonewalling” is the act of cutting yourself emotionally from people you don’t agree with or you have problems with.
-   Denying there’s a problem present
-   Failing to assert themselves
-   Allowing others to assert themselves onto them
-   Tend to say “yes” to avoid conflicts
-   Tend to be apologetically

  

Why is avoidance a destructive communication style when it comes to parent-child communication?


# Communication

Children learn how to communicate almost exclusively from their most immediate environment. This is their family. Almost everything they say verbally and nonverbally is picked up at home. Working on improving your own communication skills is not just to be a better communicator. It’s to be a better partner, a better parent, but also it is to be able to teach your own children to be better communicators as well.

  

Communication skills are vital in the development of any relationship. If you want to have a good parent-child relationship you need to work a lot on your ability to communicate. You may think you are a good communicator because you talk to many people. However, being able to talk to a baby, a toddler, or a teenager requires a different style of communication. It requires much more patience, empathy, and dedication.

  

When talking about communication and parenting we need to point out assertive and effective communication. 

  

Before we take a look at assertive and effective communication, let’s first talk about three other types of communication which are ineffective and may even be harmful and destructive.


# Passive-aggressive communication

  

This style of communication is a mix from the previous two styles. It involves the appearance of passive communication, however, the underlying message is communicated in a subtle, indirect but aggressive manner. Some parents believe that their kids are unable to sense the aggression in a conversation with this form of communication. They are nothing but wrong. Moreover, their kids will feel frustrated and anxious when they witness this form of communication.

  

-   Sabotaging to get even
-   Smiling when angry to mask their feelings
-   Using sarcasm
-   Muttering to themselves instead of communicating to their partner
-   Pouting
-   Manipulative
-   Not direct

# Discipline levels

Many of us have seen parents try to raise their children by harassment and threats without ever being carried out. If you repeat to your child, "Hey, now you'll see what happens!" without anything following, your child will simply think that the words of mom or dad are actually compressed air. Here is the place to define three levels in the application of the discipline:  
  

1.  Instruction (giving the child clear requirements for what he should do in the family; as well as a preliminary description of exact rules of behavior in accordance with their age);
2.  Warning (reminding the child of the rules and giving a clear signal of what will happen if they are not followed);

3. Correction (in case of repeated violation of the already known rules, the child must be corrected (understand punished) immediately. The methods of punishment will be mentioned later.


# How to teach children discipline?

  

Here are some specific recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics:  
  

-   When there is a problem with the discipline, it is good to react immediately, to pay attention to the behavior, to say that it is problematic and without leaving the good tone, to talk to the children as calmly and constructively as possible.
-   When discipline is not up to standard, children should be deprived of some of the privileges they have. Parents should explain to their children what will happen if they repeat the same behavior that has already been condemned. Of course, it is necessary to explain to them what is normal behavior.
-   Children should be consciously encouraged to express their emotions in words and to say how they feel. Parents need to teach their children to use words when they want to express their frustration.
-   The main role model for children remains the one that the child sees in their  parents and will probably follow them in his life, often even subconsciously. This is the best role model for your child. If you successfully control your emotions, speak calmly, when you have to repeat the same thing several times, the children will take you much more seriously and will do what you tell them. They will naturally perceive this behavior and follow it later in life.
-   Verbal reprimands and advice lose their effectiveness in relation to discipline when used too often.
-   To get the best results for disciplining a child, you need to focus more on the child's behavior. In this way, aggressive and opposing behavior in children can be reduced and corporal punishment in no way allowed as a method of education.
-   Create rules that your child can follow. Be sensible when it comes to house rules. Think about whether this rule is really necessary and whether it can be effectively enforced, or create rules that are just waiting to be broken. Make sure your rules are appropriate for the child's age, and accept that you may need to be more flexible as children grow older and need more independence.


# American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Advice

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that parents place more emphasis on counseling and speaking in trying to establish rules and discipline than resorting to corporal punishment. 

Parents must accept the development of the child not only as a physical fact, but also the growth of the child as an individual. Often the behavior of children is related to the so-called "Growth problems", which can be temporarily unpleasant, but they are inevitable and accompany the growth of each child. Whether it will be an outburst of anger, whether it will be a refusal to share, a closure in itself - all these oddities can only be related to growing up. Parents should accept them and follow them in dynamics, not condemn or rebuke them. Our discipline and reactivity in these situations comes down mostly to finding the strength to stay calm and sober judgment. Known techniques can and should be applied to control and alleviate the situation - for example, to count to 10, to gain time. The child often has his/her own answer, which will benefit everyone, as long as we are patient to listen to them.

Children are predictably unpredictable. They do not understand the parents' detailed schedules and regimes. However, moving by inertia will also not benefit either the children or us. It is most important, along with established practices, to approach the understanding that, nevertheless, the rules can be broken or changed. This approach will in most cases be more beneficial than harmful. This means that children have a general idea of ​​the regime, discipline and rules that are necessary for the free development of their socially useful abilities, and not to feel like a trap. Most pediatric academies and associations promote child discipline training through active listening.


# How to discipline yourself 

Some parents just don't want to be the bad person, others allow their children to do whatever they want because they fear that the ban will lead to an outburst of anger. There are also parents who have memories of the harsh discipline that was imposed on them when they were young and do not want to cause such a thing to their children. What you need to remember is that a parent has an obligation to his or her child to raise him or her to be a responsible adult - and to teach him or her how to behave in certain situations is part of that.


# How to keep discipline positive

If discipline is not the same as punishment, it definitely rules out slapping. Although some parents view it as an ideal short, sharp shock - especially if their child is doing something that puts them in danger - if you use it every day you risk teaching your child that physical aggression is normal. Always keep in mind that the goal is to teach the child what behavior is acceptable, not to punish them for bad behavior.


# Why children need rules

The rules of the house set limits for the child, which helps them to think in an orderly way and to communicate with other children and adults. By helping children follow the rules, you will teach them to communicate, to respect the individual. And a sense of self-control and discipline is an important quality of life. It helps us make informed decisions even when they run counter to our desire to rebel.


# Discipline or punishment?

Many parents confuse discipline with punishment, and we have to show that managing their children's behavior does not have to be a negative experience. Look at discipline as a way to teach your child the valuable skill of self-control instead of a way to control it, and you will see that it can be a positive experience. Once you help them create a sense of self-control, they will learn how to apply discipline to themselves.


# Why do children need discipline?

Many parents do not create or enforce rules for their children because they do not want to be accepted as villains. But setting boundaries is important for teaching children self-control and helping the child feel safe.

One of the main pitfalls for parents is not to set rules because they don't want it to be too difficult for their children. The problem is that this often means that parents lose control of the situation because they are too soft to set boundaries and impose consequences for bad behavior. Few aspects of parenting are as important as discipline.


# Stress management

Poor parenting seldom happens randomly. Rather, a person finds his/her life is becoming unmanageable – money problems, unruly kids, continuing conflict with one’s partner, unemployment or work tension, ill health, legal issues, etc. Another way to put it, is that the person under pressure due to the listed reasons feels trapped. In their head there seems to be no way to make things right anymore. Usually, that’s when people say “I just snapped” or “I couldn’t take it anymore.” They may add that whatever happened right before the incident wasn’t all that serious; “Normally, I could have handled it without blowing up, but I was already feeling anxious and irritable because of everything else that had been going on.”

  

Stress management can help everybody, of course, but it is needed most by these overwhelmed individuals. They need to understand that there are ways to relieve stress and that only by using them can they minimize the risk of terminating parental rights.



# What is stress?

  

The most basic explanation is that stress is our response to our environment. Evolutionarily all mammals have an unconscious system in place that scans the environment looking for any potential dangers. The autonomous nervous system (ANS) is responsible for this surroundings security scan. If the ANS happens to register a potential threat it starts all bodily processes necessary to prepare the body for the so called “fight, flight or freeze” response. The human body responds by releasing hormones which are:

-   increasing the respiratory rate (breathing rate)
-   increasing the heart rate
-   bumping up the blood pressure
-   releasing more blood sugar into the bloodstream. 

  

From a survival frame of reference it all makes perfect sense: having more energy in your body increases the chances of your surviving a potential attack. Nowadays, we don’t have the same threats as our ancestors did. When we encounter a life demand that is hard for us to fulfil, our body is tricked into perceiving this unmanageable demand as a potential threat. Hence, our body reacts the same way it would’ve reacted if a wild animal attacked us.

  

Most people will describe stress with concrete examples: deadlines, unpaid bills, arguments with their partners. However, these are just life demands that we want to fulfil and we call them stress triggers.



# Stress categories

  
  
Stress triggers can be categorized in three groups:

  
**Daily stressors**

These stressors are all predictable demands that occur on a daily basis. A good example here would be taking care of a child, or commuting to work, or doing home chores. These stressors are short-lived and they usually go away by the end of the day.

  
**Chronic stressors**

These stressors are more open-ended in nature. People describe them as a constant prolonged worry that they have. Most people will point out at as examples of chronic stress:

-   living in poverty
-   being underemployed
-   Loneliness
-   high-pressured jobs
-   Problematic partnership

  
**Unexpected stressors (Acute stress)**

These stressors are unexpected events that may occur such as:

-   Losing your job
-   Broken home appliances
-   Having a sick family member
- 

# How does stress affect your physical health?

  

Chronic exposure to stress affects your body and your physical health. Next, your body is in a constant state of alert thus under the influence of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. This may result in physical conditions such as:

-   Headaches
-   Stomachaches
-   Heartburn
-   Insomnia
-   Weakened immune system
-   Low sex drive
-   High respiratory rate
-   High heart rate
-   Obesity
-   Diabetes


# How does stress affect your mental health?

  

In contrast to the effects on physical health, your mental health can be affected by any type of stress. Effects on your mental health after stress are:

-   Anxiety
-   Restlessness
-   Anger
-   Depression
-   Lack of motivation
-   Lack of focus

# Stress management

  

Relaxation training is the key to initiating a positive stress reduction program. Try to think of as many different ways to relax as possible. And keep in mind that using alcohol, tobacco or drugs won't be in your favor and also won’t help you progress with stress and anxiety management.

  

Extremely anxious and stressed people might need a referral to a psychologist or physician for a more thorough examination and possible medical intervention. This would be appropriate if you  indicate that you can’t function in society, have become suicidal, or indicate past use of violence related to extreme stress. 

  

Anyway, most likely you are not under extreme stress but you may still be stressed. Here are some conditions that indicate that you need to a system in place to fight your stress:

-   Fatigue
-   Sleeping problems
-   Irritability
-   Headache
-   Memory problems, difficulties in concentrating, racing thoughts
-   Depression, anxiousness, feelings of loneliness and isolation, constant worrying
-   Withdrawing from other people
-   Procrastination, poor judgment, neglection of responsibilities, use of alcohol, tobacco or narcotics
-   Weight gain or weight loss

  

If you have some of those symptoms, follow these 5 advice in order to get to manage your levels of stress and anxiety:

  

1.  Take a 10 minute walk. According to experts, taking a walk will help reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) in the system.
2.  Practice mindfulness. Try to calm yourself by guiding your thoughts in a positive way.
3.  Create an exercise regiment. Not only physically you will change but also you will train your mind to be more precise and controlled.
4.  Write a reflection journal. By doing that, pinpoint stressors. This will help you change your perspective about those triggers to deactivate them.
5.  Organize yourself. Try to set mini goals for each day and organise your schedule. Putting things in order will help alleviate the chronic and daily stress.
